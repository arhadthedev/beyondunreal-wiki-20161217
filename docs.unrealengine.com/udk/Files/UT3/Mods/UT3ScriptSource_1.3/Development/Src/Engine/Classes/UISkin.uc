/**
 * Represents a collection of UIStyles.
 * <p>
 * When a style is created, it is assigned a persistent STYLE_ID.  All styles for a particular widget are stored in a single
 * unreal package file.  The root object for this package is a UISkin object.  The resources required by the style
 * may also be stored in the skin file, or they might be located in another package.
 * <p>
 * A game UI is required to have at least one UISkin package that will serve as the default skin.  Only one
 * UISkin can be active at a time, and all custom UISkins are based on the default UISkin.  Custom UISkins may decide to
 * override a style completely by creating a new style that has the same STYLE_ID as the skin to be replaced, and placing
 * that skin into the StyleLookupTable under that STYLE_ID.  Any styles which aren't specifically overridden in the custom
 * UISkin are inherited from the default skin.
 *
 * By default, widgets will automatically be mapped to the customized version of the UIStyle contained in the custom
 * UISkin, but the user may choose to assign a completely different style to a particular widget.  This only changes
 * the style of that widget for that skin set and any UISkin that is based on the custom UISkin.  Custom UISkins can be
 * hierarchical, in that custom UISkins can be based on other custom UISkins.
