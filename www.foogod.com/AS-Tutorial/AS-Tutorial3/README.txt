This is an example UT2004 map designed to accompany the Assault Mapping
Tutorial on the Unreal Wiki (http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/).  This map shows
everything discussed in the tutorial up through the 'Attacking and Defending'
section, and also has the interior architecture for the base as described in
the beginning of 'Continuing the Assault'.
