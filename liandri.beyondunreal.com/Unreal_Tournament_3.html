</p><p><b>Unreal Tournament 3</b>, also known as <b>UT3</b> (previously codenamed <b>Envy</b> and also formerly named <b>Unreal Tournament 2007</b>, <b>UT2007</b>, or <b>UT2k7</b>) is <a href="Epic_Games.html" title="Epic Games">Epic Games</a>' sequel to <a href="Unreal_Tournament_2004.html" title="Unreal Tournament 2004">Unreal Tournament 2004</a>. Published by <a href="https://liandri.beyondunreal.com/edit/Midway_Games?redlink=1" class="new" title="Midway Games (page does not exist)">Midway Games</a>, UT3 is powered by Epic's new <a href="Unreal_Engine_3.html" title="Unreal Engine 3" class="mw-redirect">Unreal Engine 3</a>. The game was released in late November 2007 for the PC, December 2007 (NA) and February 2008 (EU) for PS3, and July 2008 for XBox 360. Linux and OSX versions of the game were planned but never released, with no official explanation given for the cancellations. The two versions of the game were apparently far along with Ryan Gordon even posting screenshots of the game running on the two platforms<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#note-0">[1]</a></sup>.
</p><p>Unreal Tournament 3 is the fourth game in the Unreal Tournament series and the eighth game in the overall Unreal series. The game is numbered by generation, with <a href="Unreal_Tournament.html" title="Unreal Tournament">Unreal Tournament</a> representing the first generation, <a href="Unreal_Tournament_2003.html" title="Unreal Tournament 2003">Unreal Tournament 2003</a> and <a href="Unreal_Tournament_2004.html" title="Unreal Tournament 2004">Unreal Tournament 2004</a> representing the second generation, and UT3 representing the third generation.
</p><p>On May 8th, 2014 it was announced that a new Unreal Tournament game would be developed alongside the community. The game is titled simply <b>Unreal Tournament</b> but is referred to as <a href="Unreal_Tournament_4.html" title="Unreal Tournament 4">Unreal Tournament 4</a> signifying the fourth generation of the Unreal Tournament series.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>UT3 was revealed to the world in the May 2005 issue of Computer Gaming World magazine. The first news of it began to appear on or around March 27, 2005. The game was originally codenamed UT "Envy", but later, around May 29, 2005, it was revealed that the name had been changed to <b>Unreal Tournament 2007</b>. It was not until January 25, 2007 at the Midway Gamer's Day event in Las Vegas that it was revealed that the game's name had been changed to <b>Unreal Tournament 3</b>. This change was met with great enthusiasm from the Unreal fan base.
</p><p>Early in the development of the game, many features were discussed that were later dropped. A game mode named <b>Conquest</b> was originally announced as a war spanning multiple levels with lots of dynamic things like <a href="Nanoblack.html" title="Nanoblack">nanoblack</a> taking over parts of levels owned by the <a href="Necris.html" title="Necris">Necris</a>. An updated version of Onslaught entitled <b>Onslaught 2.0</b> was also discussed early in the game's development cycle.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#note-1">[2]</a></sup>. LAter both of these game modes were collapsed into Warfare.
</p><p>Unreal Tournament 3 promised a return to the "feel" of the original Unreal Tournament. Epic's aim was to make the game more in-your-face, fast-paced, and less "floaty". To accomplish this, gravity was increased and dodge jump was removed. However, dodging, double jumps, and wall dodging remained. Gameplay in UT3 stresses close combat and projectile weapons more than any of its predecessors.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Beta_Demo">Beta Demo</span></h3>
<p>At Midnight on Friday, October 12th, 2007, Fileplanet began preloading the game to its subscribers. The demo was unlocked and released on FilePlanet at 12:35 PM on Friday, October 12th. The release was apparently several hours earlier than intended, probably in response to a Norwegian site, "IT Avisen", leaking the demo approximately 5 hours earlier than FilePlanet.
</p><p>The demo, which was Version 3464, came with 3 maps: <a href="DM-ShangriLa.html" title="DM-ShangriLa">DM-ShangriLa</a>, <a href="DM-HeatRay.html" title="DM-HeatRay">DM-HeatRay</a>, and <a href="VCTF-Suspense.html" title="VCTF-Suspense">VCTF-Suspense</a>. Of note is that DM-HeatRay was the first taste of the <a href="Necris.html#Technology" title="Necris">Necris vehicles</a>, specifically, the <a href="Darkwalker.html" title="Darkwalker">Darkwalker</a>.
</p><p>Epic called the release an "Open Beta Demo" in an attempt to signify the incomplete status of the demo. Epic promised to respond to user feedback in order to fix issues in the final game. Several issues reported during the beta demo period were fixed or began to be fixed in the first patch. An updated demo fixing these issues was never released.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Release_Details">Release Details</span></h3>
<p>On November 12th, 2007 (a full seven days prior to the NA release), the German version of the game was released to German retailers. In order to comply with German regulations for public game sales, the game had blood, gibs, and headshots removed from the game. Very little else was changed except for the localization to German.
</p><p>The US retail release came on November 19th, 2007. This, however, was the "ship" date, and thus many stores did not receive physical product until November 20th, 2007. The Canadian release came on November 20, and stores put it on shelves the very next day. The European release came on November 23, 2007.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Reception">Reception</span></h3>
<p>Reception to the beta demo was generally positive, with most people agreeing that Epic has "got it right." There was some notable dissension from the crowd who enjoyed UT2003 and UT2004 though, particularly about the removal of dodge jump. Unreal Tournament players, which Epic were targeting, didn't switch to UT3 either due to steep system requirements and the overall unstable state of the game for months after release.
</p><p>Reception to the game on PC was been mostly favorable from the community and warm from reviewers, with a score of 83 on Metacritic<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#note-2">[3]</a></sup>. Warfare, in particular, has been praised for being a more strategic and improved version of <a href="Onslaught.html" title="Onslaught">Onslaught</a>, though the gametype turned off many veteran Onslaught players due to additions like the Orb.
</p><p>Several issues with the game led to low player numbers, with the key issues being:
</p>
<ul><li> Lackluster Single-Player and no Tournament mode
<dl><dd> While the Single-Player was hyped a lot, it failed to deliver. It was too long and it completely replaced the old Tournament mode. It also had awkward explanations for classic arena gametypes, like <b><a href="FLaG.html" title="FLaG">FLaGs</a></b> (<b>F</b>ield <b>La</b>ttice <b>G</b>enerators) and that scoring points ran out enemy <a href="Respawner.html" title="Respawner">respawners</a>. 
</dd></dl>
</li><li> Awkward and simple UI
<dl><dd> The UI felt very awkward and was very simple compared to previous UT games. There were very little options available for common settings, and overall the UI felt very unfinished. Many settings could be changed via INI, however often these settings do not save, revert, or appear to have no effect. As of Patch 2.0, the UI has been reworked with a new color scheme and more advanced options, fixing many of the prior complaints. As of June 2014, Gamespy has been removed from UT3 which fixed many of the issues with config files reverting.
</dd></dl>
</li><li> Astoundingly bad Server Admin launch
<dl><dd> Perhaps the worst problem, due to UT3 being primarily a multiplayer game, are issues with the server admin tools. The initial release of the Windows dedicated server package was littered with bugs preventing a significant number of hosts from running servers. The Linux dedicated server was released a month after the retail game, on December 18, 2007 which left many hosts without any UT3 package to offer. Web Admin was also missing from both the original release and the first patch, though it was released alongside Patch 2 and received steady updates until support ended for the game in 2009.
</dd></dl>
</li><li> Modding support simplified
<dl><dd> Another key complaint with the game is that much of what used to be done in UnrealScript has been moved to native code, supposedly as a way to improve performance on consoles. This, however, has made it increasingly difficult to develop proper mods and mutators for the game in many instances. As of Patch 2.0, modding support improved drastically however it was never as easy as it had been in previous games.
</dd></dl>
</li></ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Collectors_Edition">Collectors Edition</span></h3>
<p>On October 26, 2007, a limited collector's edition of the game was announced to be released on PC. This version of the game featured an exclusive Collector's Edition tin and a hardcover art book. A bonus DVD is also included featuring more than 20 hours of Unreal Engine 3 toolkit video tutorials, the history of the Unreal Tournament series, and behind-the-scenes footage of the making of the game. The bonus DVD contained a DRM called Anti-WarHawK (AWH) which would disable video playback in isolated cases.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Linux">Linux</span></h3>
<p>Epic promised to release a Linux installer for the game that would work with the standard Windows disc. However, it was later revealed that due to unknown "legal issues" the Linux installer was not going to be released. The game only works with Windows to this day, however it is possible to run the game in Linux using Wine<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#note-3">[4]</a></sup>.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Expansion">Expansion</span></h3>
<p>On October 20th, 2008, Mark Rein announced via email that Midway and Epic were working on a "major expansion" for UT3<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#note-4">[5]</a></sup>.
</p><p>On January 26th, 2009, the first part of this expansion was revealed in the form of a major patch. This information was first revealed publicly <a href="../www.beyondunreal.com/view_story8faf.html?id=12466" class="external text" rel="nofollow">by BeyondUnreal</a>.
</p><p>The second part of this expansion was called the "Titan Pack". On February 19th, 2009, the contents of the Titan Pack were revealed<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#note-5">[6]</a></sup>. Two new gametypes (Greed and Betrayal), one new Mutator (Titans), 2 new characters (Nova and Kana from the 360 version of the game), and 16 new maps, including the five exclusive 360 maps. The Titan Pack, along with Patch 2.0, was released March 5th, 2009.
</p><p>Critics of the Titan Pack complained about the number of servers running the Titans mutator, which gave players the ability to turn into giants with overpowered weapons. Many players found this mutator uninteresting and most of the servers running after the pack was released were running the mutator.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Gamespy_Removal">Gamespy Removal</span></h3>
<p>On April 3rd, 2014 it was revealed by Glu Mobile (current owners of the Gamespy brand) that the Gamespy multiaplyer service would be shutting down on July 31st, 2014. This stood to kill the master servers for the game. Epic decided to release an update that removes Gamespy<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#note-6">[7]</a></sup> and replaces it with an in-house solution. This had the side effect of killing the stats tracking for the game entirely and disabling the in-game friend list, however with the update it is still possible to play the game online and continue to host servers for the game.

<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Version_History">Version History</span></h4>
<p>The last and final official version of UT3 is Version 2.1 (3809) also known as "Patch 5".
</p><p>On January 29th, 2009, it was revealed that owners of the retail copy of UT3 would be able to use their CD key to register the game on Steam<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#note-7">[8]</a></sup>. Registering the game on Steam provides access to Steam-only features such as the achievements added in version 2.0 of the game.

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Gametypes">Gametypes</span></h3>
<ul><li><a href="UT3_Single_Player.html" title="UT3 Single Player">Single Player</a>
<dl><dd> A five act storyline takes the place of the old tournament ladder system from previous games. The campaign contains in-engine rendered cutscenes along with the ability to gather "cards" that can be used to gain certain advantages in maps by completing side objectives. Online four player co-op is available for the campaign. 
</dd></dl>
</li><li><a href="Deathmatch.html" title="Deathmatch">Deathmatch</a>

<dl><dd> Two teams duke it out in a quest for battlefield supremacy.  The team with the most total frags wins.
</dd></dl>
</li><li><a href="Capture_the_Flag.html" title="Capture the Flag">Capture the Flag</a>
<dl><dd> Your team must capture the enemy flag by taking it from the enemy base and returning it to their own.  If the flag carrier is killed, the flag drops to the ground for anyone to pick up.  If your team's flag is taken, it must be returned (by touching it after it is dropped) before your team can score a flag capture.
</dd></dl>
</li><li><a href="Vehicle_Capture_the_Flag.html" title="Vehicle Capture the Flag">Vehicle Capture the Flag</a>

</dd></dl>
</li><li><a href="Warfare.html" title="Warfare">Warfare</a>
<dl><dd> Create a power chain to the enemy Core by capturing Nodes in a 'connect the dots' fashion.  Nodes at the end of a chain may be controlled by either team.  Control Nodes for your team by touching them to start the build process (use the Link Gun alt-fire to speed things up).  Once your team has a link to the enemy Core, attack and destroy it.

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Weapons">Weapons</span></h3>
<ul><li><a href="Deployables.html#Unreal_Tournament_3" title="Deployables">Deployables</a>
<dl><dd> Strategy-themed devices. These are the Stasis Field, Energy Shield, Spidermine Trap, EMP, Shaped Charge, X-Ray Field, and the Link Station. These are dropped by the <a href="Necris.html" title="Necris">Necris</a> <a href="Nightshade.html" title="Nightshade">Nightshade</a>, the <a href="Axon.html" title="Axon" class="mw-redirect">Axon</a> <a href="Stealthbender.html" title="Stealthbender">Stealthbender</a>, or are carried by hand.
</dd></dl>
</li><li><a href="Translocator.html" title="Translocator">Translocator</a>
<dl><dd> This <a href="Unreal_series.html" title="Unreal series">Unreal series</a> favorite returns to the <a href="Capture_the_Flag.html" title="Capture the Flag">Capture the Flag</a> gametype, except for maps that contain vehicles, in which the hoverboard becomes the secondary method of transportation. There are more charges than UT2004 (7 compared to 6) and they refill faster. (About one per second.) Also, the disc has a flatter trajectory than UT2004 and it fires farther than UT, but not quite as far at UT2004. 
</dd></dl>
</li><li><a href="Impact_Hammer.html" title="Impact Hammer">Impact Hammer</a>
<dl><dd> This favorite from <a href="Unreal_Tournament.html" title="Unreal Tournament">Unreal Tournament</a> makes a comeback with an EMP alt-fire that severely damages vehicles and can remove powerups from other players. One of the newer effects of the Impact Hammer is that if you get several kills with it, blood and gore smear over the hammer - eventually making it more red than orange.
</dd></dl>
</li><li><a href="Enforcer.html" title="Enforcer">Enforcer</a>
<dl><dd> Your starting weapon, the Enforcer is a pistol with rapid fire. Secondary fire shoots a less accurate triple burst. You spawn with one enforcer, though if a player is killed while holding the weapon it is dropped, and picking up a second enforcer allows you to hold two at a time. As a homage to the original Enforcer's alternate fire, they now turn sideways when you are close to an opponent.
</dd></dl>
</li><li><a href="Bio_Rifle.html" title="Bio Rifle">Bio Rifle</a>
<dl><dd> This weapon fires a big slow arcing gob of sludge that can instantly take out a heavily armed opponent or stick to floors and walls, then break apart into smaller pieces creating an instant minefield. Players with a large amount of slime attached to them will get rapidly "chipped" in damage, but they will have a second or two to fight back before dying, giving them a chance to take out the enemy who hit them.
</dd></dl>
</li><li><a href="Shock_Rifle.html" title="Shock Rifle">Shock Rifle</a>
<dl><dd> A classic weapon, the Shock Rifle fires an instant-hit beam of energy when primary fire is used, and a floating ball of energy when secondary fire is used. Players can also shoot the ball of energy with the beam to create a shock combo, dealing intense amounts of damage in a small radius (enough to kill a player wearing even medium armor). When compared to past titles, the shock balls have been sped up from <a href="UT2004.html" title="UT2004" class="mw-redirect">UT2004</a> to be more closely match the rate of the original <a href="UT.html" title="UT" class="mw-redirect">UT</a>. The primary rate of fire has also been reduced. Shock combos will now suck up ragdolls in a small vortex, and gib them if it does so.
</dd></dl>
</li><li><a href="Link_Gun.html" title="Link Gun">Link Gun</a>
<dl><dd> The link gun shoots small fast moving plasma balls similar to those in the original <a href="UT.html" title="UT" class="mw-redirect">UT</a>. The secondary shoots a straight arc of plasma that can skeletize foes, heal vehicles and charge power nodes.
</dd></dl>
</li><li><a href="Minigun.html" title="Minigun">Stinger Minigun</a>
<dl><dd> The stinger from the original <a href="Unreal.html" title="Unreal">Unreal</a> replaces the <a href="Minigun.html" title="Minigun">Minigun</a> as a fast firing semi-projectile weapon. The gun has two modes, a fast but inaccurate spread of <a href="Tarydium.html" title="Tarydium">Tarydium</a> crystal shards that hits instantly, and a slower firing more powerful projectile shot that uses two shards and can also sometimes nail opponents to the wall with the killing blow.
</dd></dl>
</li><li><a href="Flak_Cannon.html" title="Flak Cannon">Flak Cannon</a>
<dl><dd> Primary fire for this weapon releases a number of chunks of metal, tearing enemies into shreds. The secondary fire releases an undetonated flak shell that detonates and turns to shrapnel on impact. Compared to past titles, the primary fire bounces more and has a much tighter spread, while the flak shell does not travel as far as it did in <a href="UT2004.html" title="UT2004" class="mw-redirect">UT2004</a>, but it has a much higher upward arc.
</dd></dl>
</li><li><a href="Rocket_Launcher.html" title="Rocket Launcher">Rocket Launcher</a>
<dl><dd> The new rocket launcher combines the instant rockets ability from <a href="UT2004.html" title="UT2004" class="mw-redirect">UT2004</a>, and the grenades from <a href="UT.html" title="UT" class="mw-redirect">UT</a>. As in <a href="UT2004.html" title="UT2004" class="mw-redirect">UT2004</a> primary fire shoots instant rockets, secondary fire loads rockets, and hitting primary while holding secondary will switch to spiral fire mode with a single tap, grenades with two, or back to a spread with three. As in UT2004, rockets can lock onto vehicles. This feature has been visibly improved to help take out vehicles, with much better locking and turning ability.
</dd></dl>
</li><li><a href="Sniper_Rifle.html" title="Sniper Rifle">Sniper Rifle</a>
<dl><dd> The classic sniper rifle has returned to replace the <a href="Lightning_Gun.html" title="Lightning Gun">Lightning Gun</a> as the primary long range weapon. It now features a orange-colored tracer, and Bolt Action reloading.
</dd></dl>
</li><li><a href="AVRiL.html" title="AVRiL">Longbow AVRiL</a>
<dl><dd> The AVRiL is now hand loaded. Its tracking beam can be used to "herd" <a href="Deployables.html#Spidermine_Trap" title="Deployables">Spider Mines</a>, much like the alt-fire on the <a href="Mine_Layer.html" title="Mine Layer">Mine Layer</a> in <a href="UT2004.html" title="UT2004" class="mw-redirect">UT2004</a>, and the tracking beam is also visible to combat problems where a person could get shot with AVRiLs and not know where the enemy is. If a friendly teammate fires an AVRiL and they have not locked onto a target after a few seconds, it is possible to use your own AVRiL to lock onto a target with the targeting beam, which will actually cause the missile to come flying back towards its new target!
</dd></dl>
</li><li><a href="Redeemer.html" title="Redeemer">Redeemer</a>
<dl><dd> Acting as the sole super weapon in this title, the redeemer fires a small nuclear warhead, capable of killing anybody within range regardless of how they are protected, and destroying all but the most heavily armored vehicles. It takes a few seconds to fully prepare and arm, and it takes up a large portion of your visibility as it is doing so. Primary fire just releases the warhead, while secondary fire gives you the ability to guide it. If you are close to the epicenter, but not directly exposed to damage, you may be knocked off your feet for a moment, as if you had fallen off the hoverboard. As always, a good shot can take the redeemer down, giving both the firing player and the sharpshooter a "Denied!" award.
</dd></dl>
</li></ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Pickups">Pickups</span></h3>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Powerups">Powerups</span></h4>
<p>All Powerups are dropped when the player is killed, or if they are knocked off of the player with the Altfire of the Impact Hammer.
</p>
<ul><li><a href="Jump_Boots.html" title="Jump Boots">Jump Boots</a>
<dl><dd>The Jump Boots return from UT, and are activated by double jumping. It is possible to dodgejump as you could in UT2004, if and only if you have these boots.
</dd></dl>
</li><li><a href="Berserk.html" title="Berserk">Berserk</a>
<dl><dd>Increases weapon rate of fire speed. Combined with the Damage Amplifier, the game will give you a "Juggernaut" award. Additionally, it will also supply full ammo for all the weapons you currently have. Weapons whose rate of fire is not increased (such as the Stinger's primary fire) will act as if they have a damage amplifier, instead.
</dd></dl>
</li><li><a href="Damage_Amplifier.html" title="Damage Amplifier">Damage Amplifier</a>
<dl><dd>Gives double damage. Combined with the Berserk, the game will give you a "Juggernaut" award.
</dd></dl>
</li><li><a href="Invulnerability.html" title="Invulnerability">Invulnerability</a>
<dl><dd>Grants you total invincibility from all things except for falling off the map or otherwise instant kill zones. Watch out for players who use the Impact Hammer's altfire to knock it off you!
</dd></dl>
</li><li><a href="Invisibility.html" title="Invisibility">Invisibility</a>
<dl><dd>Makes the player very difficult/impossible to see. Note that on Detail Level 1, players literally <i>ARE</i> completely invisible!
</dd></dl>
</li><li><a href="Deployables.html#Unreal_Tournament_3" title="Deployables">Slow Field</a>
<dl><dd>Just like the Stasis Field deployable, except this sucker's portable.
</dd></dl>
</li></ul>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Health">Health</span></h4>
<ul><li><a href="Health_Vial.html" title="Health Vial" class="mw-redirect">Health Vial</a> - Small and Green. Heals 5 Health, up to a maximum of 199.
</li><li><a href="Health_Pack.html" title="Health Pack" class="mw-redirect">Health Pack</a> - Large, White Health Packs that somewhat resemble UT2004's Kegs, but a bit more rounded and without the blue. Heals 25 Health, up to a maximum of 100.
</li><li><a href="Big_Keg_O%27_Health.html" title="Big Keg O' Health" class="mw-redirect">Big Keg O' Health</a> - As always, the Keg of health provides an instant +100 Health boost, up to 199 health.
</li></ul>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Armor">Armor</span></h4>
<ul><li><a href="Shield_Belt.html" title="Shield Belt" class="mw-redirect">Shield Belt</a>
<dl><dd>The Shield Belt returns, although it provides only 100 points of protection. However, unlike the UT2004 shields, the shield belt will absorb 100% of damage, as UT2003 shields do, until it is destroyed. If you are wearing a shield belt and in a vehicle when it is destroyed, you will not die instantly - instead, you will be ejected from the vehicle like in UT2004 assault maps while in Vehicles, but it will cost the Shield Belt. You will also not fall from your Hoverboard if you have a Shield belt.
</dd></dl>
</li><li><a href="Armor_Vest.html" title="Armor Vest" class="mw-redirect">Armor Vest</a>
<dl><dd>The Armor Vest provides 50 points of protection, and absorbs 75% of taken damage.
</dd></dl>
</li><li><a href="Thigh_Pads.html" title="Thigh Pads" class="mw-redirect">Thigh Pads</a>
<dl><dd>The Thigh Pads provide 30 points of protection, and absorbs 50% of taken damage.
</dd></dl>
</li><li><a href="Helmet.html" title="Helmet" class="mw-redirect">Helmet</a>
<dl><dd>The Helmet provides 20 points of protection, and absorbs 50% of taken damage. One feature this piece of armor has that is unique, is its ability to block headshots. Assuming you have at least 1 point of Helmet Armor on, if your character suffers a headshot, it will not affect him or damage him at all - however, the helmet will be destroyed.
</dd></dl>
</li></ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Vehicles">Vehicles</span></h3>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Axon">Axon</span></h4>
<ul><li><a href="Scorpion.html" title="Scorpion">Scorpion</a> 
<dl><dd> The primary fire shoots high steel carbo-fragment balls that explode on contact; these are particularly effective against other vehicles, but especially against the <a href="Manta.html" title="Manta">Manta</a>, <a href="Viper.html" title="Viper">Viper</a>, and <a href="Hoverboard.html" title="Hoverboard">Hoverboard</a>, upon which they home in on. It also now features a speed boost feature. You can eject from the Scorpion when using it in this manner, and it will blow up and detonate upon impact. If it kills someone due to the explosion, the game will reward you with a "Bullseye!" award.
</dd></dl>
</li><li><a href="Hellbender.html" title="Hellbender">Hellbender</a> 
<dl><dd> The new rendition of the hellbender places the driver in control over the skymine turret, while the rear turret functions differently from <a href="UT2004.html" title="UT2004" class="mw-redirect">UT2004</a>, being more like a standard turret instead of the twin-beam configuration. The rear turret can either be rapidly fired for low damage or given a brief moment to recharge for more power.
</dd></dl>
</li><li><a href="Manta.html" title="Manta">Manta</a> 
<dl><dd> In addition to a visual update, players will no longer be able to ride on top of the side fans. The Manta is also unable to hit players without crouching down anymore unless the player is on a hoverboard or a slope.
</dd></dl>
</li><li><a href="Raptor.html" title="Raptor">Raptor</a>
<dl><dd> Besides the visual update, the Raptor now seems to be a bit more responsive to maneuvering, and both the rate of fire and locking ability for its missiles have dramatically improved.
</dd></dl>
</li><li><a href="Cicada.html" title="Cicada">Cicada</a>
<dl><dd> Sporting a much bulkier and boxier look, the Cicada is mostly unchanged, however, ascending and descending seems even faster than before. Missiles can still be charged and held with the Altfire.
</dd></dl>
</li><li><a href="Paladin.html" title="Paladin">Paladin</a>
<dl><dd> Visually much improved from it's UT 2004 debut. The shield will no longer remain deployed if it goes through buildings or other level geometry, and it will get dimmer with sustained damage to allow visual estimation of how charged the shield is. Furthermore, using the shield combo to knock away nearby infantry is now instantaneous, as well as depleting the shield slightly, taking about six combos before the shield is down. It seems to be slightly faster, as well.
</dd></dl>
</li><li><a href="SPMA.html" title="SPMA">Hellfire SPMA</a>
<dl><dd> The skymine turret is now controlled by the driver when the paladin is undeployed. There is no longer a passanger/gunner seat. The camera can now crush and kill people if it hits them (or even if they simply run into it!) and it also cannot be launched as far upward - however, to compensate, the bombing is considerably more tightly packed. There is now a visual arc that shows what path the shell will roughly take, assuming that the area is strikeable - an area that cannot be bombed will not show this targeting arc.
</dd></dl>
</li><li><a href="Goliath.html" title="Goliath">Goliath</a>
<dl><dd> The Goliath tank works effectively the same to its UT2004 equivalent. It can climb over small obstacles now, such as other vehicles, and has a much higher upward firing range than its UT2004 counterpart. Its shell range has been decreased somewhat, but they also have less randomness in each shot.
</dd></dl>
</li><li><a href="Leviathan.html" title="Leviathan">Leviathan</a>
<dl><dd> This mobile fortress still features its devastating main cannon and has added distinct weapon fire to each of its four turrets rather than UT2004's link-like projectile. Each turret also has an alternate shield function. It has considerably more armor and the Ion Cannon takes nearly twice as long to deploy, compared to the UT2004 version. Each turret can be individually destroyed as well.
</dd></dl>
</li><li><a href="Stealthbender.html" title="Stealthbender">Stealthbender</a>
<dl><dd> Axon's Stealth Research Division managed to get some of the early specs for the Necris Nightshade vehicle and have been attempting to retrofit that technology onto their own.
</dd></dl>
</li></ul>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Necris">Necris</span></h4>
<p>The Necris have six vehicles at their disposal:
</p>
<ul><li><a href="Viper.html" title="Viper">Viper</a>
<dl><dd> A single passenger speeder. The primary gun fires projectiles that bounce off walls, similar to <a href="Ripper.html" title="Ripper">Ripper</a> projectiles in the original <a href="UT.html" title="UT" class="mw-redirect">UT</a>. The vehicle can also spread out like a real life viper to hover high in the sky. Like the Scorpion, it can be used on kamikaze missions, and ram vehicles or targets from the air.
</dd></dl>
</li><li><a href="Darkwalker.html" title="Darkwalker">Darkwalker</a>
<dl><dd> This lumbering tripod has tendril-like legs that allow them to climb a wider variety of terrain compared to other vehicles. The primary weapon is an extremely powerful twin laser beam that shoots out a line of plasma. The secondary fire "screams" knocking players off their feet and out of some vehicles (Manta, Viper) or force others out of the way (Scavenger). The vehicle also features a secondary gunner position that functions similar to a Plasma Turret.
</dd></dl>
</li><li><a href="Nemesis.html" title="Nemesis">Nemesis</a>
<dl><dd> The Nemesis is the Necris answer to the Goliath, and it features an instant hit twin laser beam with zoom. The vehicle also supports different modes. When you crouch down the vehicle moves faster, but it will completely lock your aim forward, with no motion at all except for vehicular manipulation. You can also rise up to attack, but this makes you more of a target. You can also rise up even more to increase the beams' rate of fire... but this makes you nearly immobile, roughly on par with the Leviathan, as well as a very large and obvious target.
</dd></dl>
</li><li><a href="Fury.html" title="Fury">Fury</a>
<dl><dd> The Fury is a single-seated flying vehicle that specializes in shooting down other air units. This vehicle can dodge, allowing you to barrel roll out of the way. Primary fire is a hitscan beam attack, similar in nature to the Darkwalker but with less range, and with a lock-on ability once struck as well as a very quick recharge time. Altfire allows a quick burst of speed to get out of the way of missiles or shots heading your way. It was planned to hold 2 passengers, who could control small guns like the Dark Walker passenger gun, this was cancelled due to the size.
</dd></dl>
</li><li><a href="Nightshade.html" title="Nightshade">Nightshade</a>
<dl><dd> Seemingly the Necris answer to the Axon's Hellbender, this stealth-based vehicle primarily has  <a href="Deployables.html#Unreal_Tournament_3" title="Deployables">deployables</a> as weapons: <a href="Deployables.html#Spidermine_Trap" title="Deployables">Spider Mines</a>, <a href="Deployables.html#EMP" title="Deployables">EMP Mines</a>, <a href="Deployables.html#Shield_Generator" title="Deployables">Shield Generators</a>, and the <a href="Deployables.html#Stasis_Field" title="Deployables">Stasis Field</a>, commonly called the "Slow Volume." Its only other weapon is a short-range beam similar to the Link Gun's, with very limited range that heals vehicles and nodes at a greatly accelerated speed. It can uncloak to go faster, toggled with Altfire.
</dd></dl>
</li><li><a href="Scavenger.html" title="Scavenger">Scavenger</a>
<dl><dd> This spherical vehicle can extend its legs and pull itself up terrain or retract them and roll on the ground like a ball. It also has a spinning attack that is effective against infantry. A small ball hovers around the vehicle; it is this orb that attacks directly and not the Scavenger, which acts more like a targeting device for this orb to attack. It can move at great speeds while rolling on the ground, but has little control as a result. Ramming into other vehicles at great speed while rolling as a ball damages them considerably.
</dd></dl>
</li></ul>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Other">Other</span></h4>
<ul><li><a href="Hoverboard.html" title="Hoverboard">Hoverboard</a>
<dl><dd> Pressing the translocator button will cause the player to hop on a hovering skate-board like device that is used mainly for transportation and is present only in Warfare and Vehicle Capture the Flag maps. The flag or orb may be carried on the Hoverboard, but any amount of damage, even one point, will send the player tumbling (this includes falling damage) in addition to dropping the orb or flag, if they carried it, unless the player is currently wearing a Shieldbelt. A player who falls off will be prone for a moment before being able to get up, which could naturally be fatal if there's opposition in the area. This also extends to grappling onto a vehicle, so if the carrier is shot from high up as they're attached to a raptor or other flying vehicle, it is generally lethal unless the player has lots of armor and health.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> These formerly stationary one-man laser cannons are now equipped with rails, offering the turret limited mobility in order to help prevent attackers from taking advantage of the terrain by obtaining angles of shot that cannot be avoided. These come in four delicious flavors: Energy Turrets, Shock Turrets, Rocket Turrets, and Stinger Turrets.

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Maps">Maps</span></h3>
<p>This time around, Epic chose to step away from the wildly different maps seen in previous tournaments, and instead create a few cohesive worlds and tie them together with their level design. 41 maps shipped with the game and 15 of them are <a href="Warfare.html" title="Warfare">Warfare</a> maps. As of the Titan Pack, the total map count raised to a staggering 60 maps.

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Bonus_Content">Bonus Content</span></h3>
<p>Before any official bonus content was released, Epic "cooked" a few user created maps and mutators for use with the PS3 version to give those users something to play with. (All custom content must be created on a PC.)
</p><p>On the 20th of November 2007, AGEIA released a pack of two UT3 maps (CTF-Lighthouse_PhysX and CTF-Tornado_PhysX) to show off advanced PhysX technology. The pack was later re-released by NVIDIA and included one more map (DM-HeatRay_PhysX).
</p><p>On the 27th of March 2008, Epic released their first bonus pack, which contains three maps: <a href="DM-Morbias.html" title="DM-Morbias">DM-Morbias</a>, <a href="CTF-FacingWorlds.html" title="CTF-FacingWorlds">CTF-FacingWorlds</a> and <a href="CTF-Searchlight.html" title="CTF-Searchlight">CTF-Searchlight</a>.
</p><p>The Xbox 360 version of the game has 2 new characters (Kana of the Twin Souls and Nova of the Liandri) as well as the Bonus Pack maps and 5 exclusive maps, which are: <a href="WAR-ColdHarbor.html" title="WAR-ColdHarbor">WAR-ColdHarbor</a>, <a href="DM-KBarge.html" title="DM-KBarge">DM-KBarge</a>, <a href="VCTF-Rails.html" title="VCTF-Rails">VCTF-Rails</a>, <a href="WAR-Downtown_Necris.html" title="WAR-Downtown Necris">WAR-Downtown_Necris</a> and <a href="VCTF-Suspense_Necris.html" title="VCTF-Suspense Necris">VCTF-Suspense_Necris</a>.
</p><p>The Titan Pack is the second bonus pack. The pack includes two new game modes, one new mutator, Kana and Nova from the XBox 360, two new deployables, a new powerup, a new vehicle, two new weapons, and 16 new maps, five of which are the former XBox 360 exclusive maps. It also includes the three maps from the first bonus pack. It was released March 5th, 2009.

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Community">Community</span></h3>
<p>Epic planned to use UT3 to bring more and more people into the Unreal community, with strong community integration out of the box. In-game lobbies were planned for Warfare, and game stats integration would have allowed you to find similarly-skilled opponents via the UT3 server browser. However, none of these elements shipped with the final game.
</p><p>A global rankings system does exist to allow clans and other players to compare scores.
</p><p>PS3 users can download specially cooked versions of various maps and mutators, provided the author supplies them. However, there are some limitations, and custom sounds or music cannot be supported in PS3 versions of the maps due to a proprietary sound codec being used.
</p><p>The XBox 360 version does not support custom content. However, the Xbox 360 version of the game shipped with exclusive maps and characters not found on the PC or PS3 versions, as well as a split-screen mode. These features were added to the PC and PS3 platform with patch 2.0 and the Titan Pack, though split screen support on PC is limited.

<p>UT3 will bring major advances in the artificial intelligence that controls UT bots, as well as the way in which players communicate with them. UT3 players will be able to give bots specific orders using their own voices. Whereas in UT or UT2004 you'd use the voice menu to tell your bots to "attack", you can now give orders like "There's a sniper on the tower, go get him". Bots will also respond to particular questions. For example, if you asked "Is there anyone in the cave?", they might reply "No, the cave is clear".
</p><p>Apparently, this feature is quite buggy however. It is reported to work best for users who have a clear North American accent.
</p><p>UT3 bots' personalities will also make them better suited to different in-game tasks.
