2. Background


2.1 What is Unreal Tournament?


Unreal Tournament (aka UT) is a multiplayer, three-dimensional first-person
shooter-type game in the style of the classic Quake games. The game is written
and developed by Epic Games and published and marketed by GT Interactive. The
Linux version is developed and maintained by Loki.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2 What is OpenUT?


The OpenUT Project was formed to develop libraries, executables, and tools 
relevant to the Unreal Tournament engine. The project focuses on improving 
the quality of the UT Linux port through open source development.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.3 How did OpenUT come about?


Epic Games were developing a Linux version of the game for some time before
it was commecially released, and had hoped to provide the binaries on the same
retail CD as the Windows version. The binaries were not quite ready in time,
but they were released on the Internet afterwards.

In December 1999 Brandon Reinhart (aka 'GreenMarine'), a developer at Epic,
announced their intention to open source certain parts of the Linux game
engine in order to let the development community help to improve the code. 
Quote from his .plan around the time of the release:

"The bottom line is this: I like to play kick ass games. The Linux port 
of UT is not kick ass. I don't have the time to make it better, so instead 
of having it languish on my harddrive I'll give it out to anyone who wants 
it. You don't have to do anything with it. You could take it and write cool 
stuff and if you want you could contribute it to me. Its all voluntary."

The project was established at SourceForge in early January 2000.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.4 What is the history of OpenUT?


Shortly after the project was established, Daniel Vogel was made joint project
admin with Brandon Reinhart.

Almost all of the improvements made to the version 402 sources as released by 
Epic were incorporated into the 413 release for Linux.

After the release of the 413 patch, there was no further source release: OpenUT
development stopped. The project mailing list and forums became general
discussion and support groups for the Linux version of UT.

Brandon left Epic; Daniel went to work for Loki.

On August 1st 2000, Loki and Epic announced that a deal had been signed for Loki
to maintain and support Unreal Tournament for Linux. Daniel Vogel confirmed
that source releases should continue, although public write access to CVS would
be removed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.5 What sources have been released?


At present, only the Linux sound and graphics rendering code.

Daniel Vogel summarised the source release as follows:

- most headers to Core / Engine
- source to
  - UTLaunch aka UnrealTournament executable
  - UCC (only a stub as it dlopens the Engine stuff)
  - Renderers
    - D3DDrv
    - GlideDrv
    - OpenGLDrv
    - XMesaGLDrv
  - Viewport Managers
    - XDrv
  - Sound (Linux part)

The OpenUT project does NOT have access to the generic renderer, the
game core, engine, server, editor, or software renderer.	    

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.6 Who is maintaining OpenUT?


At the present time (Nov 2000), the SourceForge project admins are Brandon 
Reinhart, Daniel Vogel and Andy Piper

There were a total of 14 developers who had direct access to update the OpenUT 
CVS repository, but this access has been removed now that Loki maintain the
core code for Epic. Daniel will accept patches from the open source community
against the publically-released sources, and is the principal developer and
coordinator of the project.

Below is a list of people that have contributed to the OpenUT project in
some form or another:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.7 How can I get involved?


Lots of ways - thanks for asking! ;-)

The website and the project root at SourceForge are the best starting points.
The official website is at http://openut.sourceforge.net and more information
can be found there.

Here are some things you can do to help us out.

* Join the development mailing list at http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=975
* Submit a patch to improve the source
* Do some benchmarking and send us the results
* Offer time and expertise to help with the website

Remember that you can also help us just by enjoying OpenUT, and telling us
about it!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.8 What is SDL?


(from http://www.libsdl.org/)

Simple DirectMedia Layer is a cross-platform multimedia library designed to 
provide fast access to the graphics framebuffer and  audio device. It is 
used by MPEG playback software, emulators,  and many popular games, 
including the award winning Linux port of "Civilization: Call To Power." 
Simple DirectMedia Layer supports  Linux, Win32, BeOS, along with ports in 
progress to MacOS, IRIX, Solaris, and FreeBSD.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.9 What is utah-glx?


(from http://utah-glx.sourceforge.net)

Simply put, GLX is the X extension used by OpenGL programs, it is the
glue between OpenGL (which is platform independent) and X.

The utah-glx project is building a hardware accelerated glx module for 
free Unix operating systems. Currently, we have support for 3D acceleration 
on the Matrox MGA-G200 and MGA-G400, nvidia's RIVA series, S3 ViRGE, ATI's 
Rage Pro (not Rage 128), and Intel's i810 for XFree86 3.3.x 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.10 Where can I find out more, ask questions about the project, and generally
get more help?

3. Compiling / Troubleshooting


3.1 Are precompiled binaries of OpenUT available?


Not at the present time.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2 Does it matter which version of the Linux kernel I am running?


It should NOT matter. UT is known to work with both the stable 2.2.x kernels
(the FAQ maintainer runs it under 2.2.16, for example), and also with the newer 
2.3.x development series.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.3 Will UT / OpenUT work with a multiprocessor (SMP) system?


There are plenty of reports of people running OpenUT on SMP machines (dual
Celerons seem to be favourites!).

There are no known issues with multiple processors and OpenUT.
However, please note that while there are no known problems, multiple
processors also do not give OpenUT much of a performance boost, either.

(thanks to John Fulmer)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.4 Why do I get errors related to GL include files that cannot be found?


Make sure you specify --prefix=/usr/ when you compile GLX. If this still 
fails, create a symbolic link from /usr/local/include/GL
(or /usr/include/GL, depending on your distribution) pointing to 
/usr/src/Mesa/include/GL, then rebuild UT.

Example: ln -s /usr/src/Mesa/include/GL /usr/local/include/GL

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.5 Why isn't software rendering available for UT on Linux? It is available 
for Windows!


It *IS* available!!!

Software rendering was added to the Linux port as part of the 428 patch from
Loki. To enable it, edit either (INSTALL_PATH)/System/UnrealTournament.ini or
(HOME)/.loki/ut/System/UnrealTournament.ini so that these lines appear:

[Engine.Engine]
GameRenderDevice=SDLSoftDrv.SDLSoftwareRenderDevice
WindowedRenderDevice=SDLSoftDrv.SDLSoftwareRenderDevice
RenderDevice=SDLSoftDrv.SDLSoftwareRenderDevice

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.6 How can I get a full log of what is going on when I run the game?


When launching UT, run the binary with -log > filename.log to create a 
logfile which is not cached. This will ensure that you get the full information
out of the logging routines.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.7 Why do I get the message "video memory unprotecting" when starting 
the game? I have a Voodoo graphics card.


This error is actually not Voodoo-specific, although it sometimes appears
when using the Dev3dfx kernel module. The message is a status report from
the X server, and it is usually safe to ignore it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.8 Does UT work with DRI in X?


Yes, it should work just fine with DRI.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.9 Which renderer and viewport manager should I use with my GeForce / 
Voodoo / G400 / TNT card?


As a general rule of thumb:

3dfx (Voodoo)          =    GlideDrv
all others (GLX-based) =    SDLGLDrv
non-accelerated        =    SDLSoftDrv (i.e. the software renderer)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.10 Why does everything run so slowly with utah-glx and my TNT graphics card?


At the present time utah-glx does not fully support nVidia cards, so
features such as DMA are not used, and the performance is limited. You 
should be using nVidia's own binary XFree86 4.0 driver instead.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.11 Does UT work with XFree86 4.0 and the new nVidia GLX drivers?


Yes and yes. There should be an impressive performance increase.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.12 Why are there ugly black boxes where there should be text in the menus?


This is a bug caused by the use of paletted textures. If it is an issue for 
you, then you should disable them (but only if you have this problem)

Edit UnrealTournament.ini as follows:

[SDLGLDrv.SDLGLRenderDevice]
UsePalette=0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.13 Why does the game crash out with a segfault when running with 
XFree86 4.0.1 and a Voodoo Banshee card?


If this happens (when using DRI and XF86 4.0.x), try unsetting multitexturing.

Edit UnrealTournament.ini as follows:

[SDLGLDrv.SDLGLRenderDevice]
UseMultiTexture=0

(thanks to Stuart McNicholas)

4. Linux Unreal Tournament


4.3 Can I use MODs with the Linux version of UT?


Usually ;)
You can use umodpack (http://umodpack.sourceforge.net/) to install them. Most 
MODs are compatible. Check the page on the OpenUT website for the latest 
information.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.2 How do I use the UT Bonus Pack on Linux?


First, you need to download the Bonus Pack.

To install it, use umodpack: http://umodpack.sourceforge.net/

Note that the relics will cause problems with all Linux releases of UT up to
and including 425. This is due to a known issue with the sound samples. You
should ensure that you are using 428a or better in order to avoid this problem.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.4 Does OpenUT work with Unreal, as well as with Unreal Tournament?


It depends what you mean, really. Unreal and UT are different games. The
engine for UT is enhanced over the one originally used for Unreal. UT is
fundamentally a multiplayer game, while Unreal has a single-player storyline.

It is possible to use the maps from the original Unreal CD as maps for
Unreal Tournament games - there is a shell script to help you to do this
available from the OpenUT website at http://openut.sourceforge.net 
(thanks to Matt Matthews). 

There is also a script which will allow you to run Unreal under Unreal 
Tournament, with some problems (save games don't work, and the maps Dug, 
NaliC, Ruins, Dark, and TheSunSpire are broken). However, since the 428 patch,
attempting to use this seems to have introduced a lot of problems.

The other way to run Unreal in Linux is under emulation, using WINE - see
http://www.linuxgames.com/unreal for details.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.5 Why do I get a message about Uwebadmin failing to bind to a port when 
trying to run ucc?


The web administration server tries to bind to a port number below 1024 by
default. In Linux, ports below 1024 are 'privileged' and can only be used by
the root user.

Two solutions:

* run ucc as root (the "easy" solution, not recommended)
* modify the UnrealTournament.ini file to add the setting ListenPort=8000 
  which should solve the problem. If something else is using port 8000, edit 
  the value for ListenPort to another number >1024

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.6 Can I use ngStats / ngWorldStats with Unreal Tournament for Linux?


Yes, you can. ngStats relies on a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) being installed, 
so make sure you have Java support before attempting to use these features.
Grab Java from Blackdown - http://www.blackdown.org.

There is a debate about why ngWorldStats does not appear to work properly in
patches after 413. There are a lot of opinions as to exactly what is wrong,
however it may help to edit the the INSTALL_DIR line in the file
/usr/local/games/ut/NetGamesUSA.com/ngWorldStats/bin/ngWorldStats so that it
points to the actual location of your UT installation

e.g. INSTALL_DIR='/usr/local/games/ut'

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.7 When will the latest patch be available for Linux?


Unfortunately the patches for Linux sometimes lag a few days behind the Windows
versions. In the case of the 405 patch, there was no release made for Linux at
all. This problem should be reduced now that Loki are actively maintaining the
port.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.8 Why don't you guys fix <bug-of-your-choice> in the Linux UT server?


The OpenUT project is not in a position to do so.

Feature requests, bug reports, etc. should now be directed to Loki.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.9 Why does the UT server fail to restart after a crash with an error 
about System/Core containing bad data?


When the server crashed, it left a 'core' file in the System directory. When it
restarted, it tried to read this instead of the Core.u file, and found it was
full of rubbish.

Go the the System directory and type 'rm -f core', then restart the server.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.10 Is it possible to get sound working when using an Aureal MX300 sound card?


Yes it is: you simply need to get the Aureal drivers release from 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/aureal/

(thanks to Unleaded)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.11 Is it normal to see two ucc-bin processes when running a UT server on 
Linux?


Yes. The server spawns another thread to manage the uplink, so if you have 
set DoUpLink=True in UnrealTournament.ini, you will see two processes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.12 Is it true that UT for Linux requires libesd in order to run?


Not exactly.... UT uses the SDL library. The copy of libSDL.so supplied with 
UT is compiled against libesd.so (the Enlightened Sound Daemon). ESD allows 
the audio device to be shared amongst different programs.

It is possible to get the source for SDL and compile it without ESD support - 
that should enable UT to run without libesd being present. However, if 
possible, it would be much better to install libesd.so on your system so 
that UT can use it!
