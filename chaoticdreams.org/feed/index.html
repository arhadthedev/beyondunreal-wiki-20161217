				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There hasn&#8217;t been a news post here recently, but that doesn&#8217;t mean we&#8217;re not busy. It&#8217;s just that our latest test build is taking longer than usual to be completed. We will have plenty to talk about once Warhead gets everything to a good stopping point, and shares it with the team. Hopefully before the month is out, but we do not want to rush him. He&#8217;s working on some tricky stuff, and it takes time to get it right. Besides, it&#8217;s the holidays. Turkeys and presents, and whatnot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please do check back with us in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just for something else to talk about though&#8230;, we are in fact still tossing around ideas for at least a few brand new weapons for this version of Chaos. Hopefully they will work out and be fun to use. But it&#8217;s not easy to come up with new stuff, and even when you think you&#8217;ve got a decent idea, there is a lot of back and forth about the details.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since we&#8217;re still trying to figure out how&nbsp;the new weapons should work, there&#8217;s not much point in having Thatscrawnykid go crazy with the models, or for Shadowstar to get busy with sounds. So while we do have rough ideas of the new weapons, there isn&#8217;t yet art&nbsp;to show for them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, TSK likes to stay sharp, so he put together a &#8220;practice&#8221; weapon model and shared it on the UT4 forums.&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The unstoppable<strong> Warhead</strong> was able to get the mod updated to the newest build of UT4. It wasn&#8217;t easy, there were issues, but he persevered. So he will now continue his efforts to bring the Chaos Hoverboard into the game (among other things). It&#8217;s a big project, but we are optimistic.</p>
<p>Also, <strong>Thatscrawnykid</strong> has posted this short video of what he believes will be the final art effects for the Hoverboard.</p>

This time around he is creating a new version of our crossbow. The plans for this weapon include three different types of arrows. The default would be the explosive arrows, for maximum damage. There will also be poison tipped arrows, which will be designed to penetrate armor and eat away directly at your opponent&#8217;s health. Finally an arrow with an EMP charge attached, which is designed to shut down things such as relics or vehicles.</p>
<p>In addition, warhead has his hands full both working on getting Chaos updated to the new UT4 build, and at the same time making progress on our Hoverboard. We will have much more to say about that once he gets further along in development.</p>
<p>Our goal is to have full access to your weapons arsenal while riding on the Hoverboard. We also plan to make it so that players can use their personal grappling hook &#8211; unlike the board-mounted grapple style of our first version. If this works out, it should lead to some pretty insane gameplay possibilities, considering that our new grappling hook has a cable that accurately bends around game-world objects.</p>
<p>It also is worth mentioning that Shadowstar has already submitted some fresh new sounds for the Hoverboard.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading. Plenty more to come.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are making progress! Mike, aka thatscrawnykid, has begun work on the newest version of our Proxy Mine Launcher, which we refer to as The Claw.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2853" src="http://chaoticdreams.org/wp-content/uploads/ngg_featured/TheClaw.jpg" alt="TheClaw" width="960" height="540" srcset="http://chaoticdreams.org/wp-content/uploads/ngg_featured/TheClaw.jpg 960w, http://chaoticdreams.org/wp-content/uploads/ngg_featured/TheClaw-150x84.jpg 150w, http://chaoticdreams.org/wp-content/uploads/ngg_featured/TheClaw-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></p>
<p>This weapon of course is used to launch our favorite happy yellow bombs, the Proxies.</p>
 [<a href="http://chaoticdreams.org/2016/07/18/the-new-claw-is-born/">See image gallery at localhost</a>] 
<p>The Proxies are AI driven (warhead will begin work on that soon), and they will happily bounce around and chase players throughout the level. They also seem to have a bit of an attitude, as they enjoy taunting players before blowing them up. For this, Shadowstar has already submitted a whole slew of excellent Proxy voices.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy them! We know they will enjoy You!</p>
<p>Also, while we still have much to do before it happens, we&#8217;ve already started discussing when to draw the line for our 1st public release. When the time comes, we hope some of you will help us play test. And after that we will still have a Ton of more stuff to add. Much like the Proxies, we&#8217;re just looking for a good time.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

<p>One piece pictured in the article is the new set of wings that he has created for our Vampire relic. These wings will allow Vamps to glide a bit as they jump around the level. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This past week saw the release of another testing version, #17. For the most part, it is a build in which we address many bug fixes and tweaks, so there&#8217;s not a bunch of new art to show. There is however a great new relic in place, called the Zen relic. Here&#8217;s the 1st pass description for it; </p>
<p><strong><em>When the player uses this relic, they will put away their weapon, enter into a crossed-legged yoga stance, and float in the air. During this time they will receive no damage whatsoever.</em></strong></p>
<p>Again, the art isn&#8217;t in place for Zen yet, but warhead has coded it wonderfully (with some minor tweaks still to go), and Shadowstar has really outdone himself with the sounds. This is another prime example of how good sound work can dramatically improve the user experience.  </p>
<p>As soon as our artists get some kickin&#8217; art in place for the Zen, we will post it here. </p>
<p>There is however, some new art by thatscrawnykid, as he has begun to put together a new version of the Chaos rail gun, called the ERDW. More on that to come. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[ [<a href="http://chaoticdreams.org/2016/04/09/epic-blogs-chaos-part-2/">See image gallery at localhost</a>]  Part 2 of a Chaos interview has been posted over at Epic Game&#8217;s UT blog. This time around the focus is on our long time sound designer, Rob (aka Shadowstar). As it turns out, it comes at the same time that he has just posted another set of new sounds for this version of the mod.</p>
<p>Shadowstar is currently focusing his efforts on our new and improved Personal Teleporter. Chaos first had a Teleporter back in our Quake 2 version, but now we&#8217;ve taken some inspiration from UT, and re-imagined our teleporter in a way that blends a bit of Chaos with a bit of UT.</p>
<p>Our new version is activated by launching a disc (as seen in the screenshot), and the player then teleports to where the disc lands. This &#8216;tele-disc&#8217; however, can also be remotely piloted by the player, enabling them to take it to just about anywhere in the map they want to go,</p>
<p>Lots of sounds are needed for this feature to be complete. Everything from piloting the disc, teleporting, re-calling disc, disc being destroyed, and so forth. As we&#8217;ve said before, since this is a Video game, it&#8217;s not uncommon for players to overlook the sounds, and focus on the visuals. But we all know that no feature would work well, or seem complete, without quality sounds.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a small selection of Shadowstar&#8217;s work for the new Chaos Teleporter;</p>
