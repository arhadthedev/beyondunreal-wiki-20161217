F12 CALLS THE SERVER ONLY FUNCTION
F11 CALLS THE CLIENT ONLY FUNCTION

BOTH OF THESE WILL PLACE LOGS ON EACH BOX AS PER THE ACTUAL CODE.


PURPOSE: ILLUSTRATES HOW PLAYER INPUT COMMANDS FROM THE SERVER, (EXEC'S AND THINGS LIKE PLAYERMOVE) ARE NOT ABLE TO DIRECTLY CALL FUNCTIONS ON A CLIENT.

SOLUTION: HAVE THE EXEC FUNCTION SET A BOOLEAN AND THEN HAVE TICK() OR TIMER() CHECK AGAINST THE BOOLEAN AND CALL THE FUNCTION FOR US.

cOMMENTS AND CORRECTIONS ARE WELCOME
