This simple add-on allows to control winamp from UT. Just open "Winamp control" from UT's mod menu and you'll be able to:

* play/pause/stop
* next/previous track
* volume up/down
* forward/rewind
* toggle repeat
* toggle shuffle 

Winamp controlling code was written thanks to: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/stl/Winamp_Controller.aspx. You're free to modify the sources and release or use 'em in your own projects. Just be nice and give me a Credit :). My all other add-ons can be found over here: http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/wiki/Raven
