      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Just wanted to say Happy Thanksgiving to all who celebrate it! <br />
<br />
Also support for today will likely be limited, if we happen to get on and can solve a problem quickly we will but today will be spent with our families. <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /><br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello everyone!<br />
<br />
Just wanted to do a little check in as it has been awhile since our last news post. Here&#039;s a little snippet of what we&#039;ve been up to:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>XenBase 1.5.x Not entirely sure what we&#039;ll label this as but the release is coming out nice. We&#039;re making sure we do extra testing with various setups as it has come to my attention that we can be doing things better than we have on some of our properties.</li>
<li>Two new styles which we&#039;re looking at showcasing shortly after the next...</li>
</ul><br />

<br />
Before we go we want to thank everyone for an awesome 2015. The support from our customers has been tremendous and we&#039;ve grown so much since 2014 thanks to all of you. <br />
<br />
Be safe and have fun, we&#039;ll see everyone soon enough!]]></content:encoded>

In the past we&#039;ve been asked where clients can post their reviews about us and we typically directed them to a thread I started a few years ago on XenForo.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Starting today, we will be limiting sales of the TeamSpeak 3 Integration add-on. While many customers are successfully able to establish connections between XenForo and TeamSpeak, the variance in TeamSpeak server configurations is causing problems for a handful of customers. While dedicated TeamSpeak servers are generally working great, the issues mostly stem from rented servers and the different ways providers have configured these.<br />

As such, we don&#039;t feel it&#039;s right to have it out there...<br />
