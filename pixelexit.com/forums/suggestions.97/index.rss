      <content:encoded><![CDATA[So i was thinking that the small holiday joy addon could do with a small upgrade, one that includes different events for the year.<br />
<br />
it should include<br />
-Christmas (which is already does)<br />
-Halloween<br />
-Easter<br />
-Thanks Giving<br />
-Birthday<br />
-New year<br />
<br />
I think that having cool images like the holiday joy one around the year would be a nice addition to any forum.]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[I purchased this today on Thanksgiving,  but I&#039;m not sure I can use this in it&#039;s current state.<br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t realize how bare bones it is. <br />
<br />
Top reasons I can&#039;t use this now:<br />
<br />
1. Have to manually build each field AND manually add users. I&#039;m basically duplicating the Member list by hand. Solution:  There needs to be a syncing feature with the member list and/or a way to automatically add users when they are added to a user group. <br />
<br />
2. Users need a way to enter info.]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Working the same as Teamspeak Intigration, Discord Intigration would have all the same features, just use a much different API.<br />
<br />
Discord is putting the nuce around Teamspeaks neck because they are completely free, have much more complete android, iphone, and even blackberry apps. Use IRC chat for seperatly integrating, into other software, like twitch and minecraft servers. And have a much easier to use permission system. All this for FREE.<br />

I have already paid for the TS Integration but...<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[One thing that would be extremely useful is a check for similar AMS or Vaultwiki articles because that will really cut down on the number of tickets.<br />
The idea is that the user first posts his question. Then if there is no answer in the articles, they can go on to post a ticket. If there are articles for frequently asked questions then this method cuts down on 80% of the tickets.<br />

I would even add the idea how easy it is to import the groups as a sales tactic.<br />
