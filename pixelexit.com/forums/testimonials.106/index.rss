      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello Everyone,<br />
<br />
I recently purchased the theme Flat Awesome + right here at pixelexit.com and I could not be more happier. Instead of calling it Flat Awesome +, it should be called Flat Awesome A+. Because this theme is of A+ quality.<br />
<br />
I have to admit that I was a little sceptical about this theme prior to purchasing it, because I did not think it would offer what I needed as far as features, style options, functions, etc... but boy was I surprised. After installing it and spending the last...<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been running message forums for many years, nearly 20 years now. In my opinion, Pixel Exit is the best them designer I have ever seen. Their themes completely allow customization by those who use them and offer many ways to make them better. They do more with their themes with having custom footers and additional features to make the themes better as well.<br />

I own the largest Skywarn Forum online which is powered by XenForo and I am proud to say that its theme is providing by Pixel Exit....<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Let me first say that I have been a customer of vBulletin, IPB, and a few of the other forum software before.  The companies I used for themes or modifications can not even touch the quality of PE.  The quality is all across the board from the actual Styles themselves to the customer service.  The responses are quick and helpful.  Being new to this software, they are very helpful and friendly in making sure you understand what needs to be done and truly care about their customers.  I will be...<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[I am a new user of XF and Pixel Exit was my first choice for getting a custom style. I ended up choosing the Detour theme for customization as it is dark, minimalistic and would require the least amount of editing to fit to my niche. After a while of communication, <a href="https://pixelexit.com/members/1/" class="username" data-user="1, @Steve">@Steve</a> began developing the theme. I really liked the sketch he first provided. From then on, the process, although slow, came to a finish after debugging and resolving the most tiny little frustrating issues with...<br />

<br />
Purchasing anything from PixelExit is purchasing quality, reliability, and beauty. I have purchased FlatAwesome+ and it is just amazing. Now, what&#039;s even more amazing is this customer service provided by Russ. Oh man. This guy, does he even sleep? He replies faster than my girlfriend who just...<br />

If your looking for a great style with support that will be there every step of the way than you found it !<br />

Thank you PixelExit !]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Happened to return to the forum to download an update. I&#039;ve had the pleasure of working with Russ and the folks at the PixelExit team. The work done is unbeatable and anyone who sees our forums thinks they are among the most stunning and functional designs they have ever seen. While I would love to take all the credit <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /> it really goes to the team here. Case in point - how awesome the Xenbase system is, how often it is updated and how well it functions for the most part in all major browsers...<br />

<br />
I&#039;ve been a customer of PixelExit for just under two weeks now, and last night I finally got around to relaunching my website and switching from vBulletin to Xenforo.  I spent a lot of time choosing the right skin to use as the basis of my redesign, and I really wasn&#039;t familiar with the Xenforo options and template structure.  I was also keen to...<br />

If anyone is looking for a custom theme from PixelExit make sure they include the XenBase Framework it makes it easy for non expert guys like me to edit things easily. When Russ first made the style it was alot of template changes and CSS and now it&#039;s all style properties and CSS...<br />

Russ stayed in contact with me the whole time and was great doing business with him. While the theme isn&#039;t 100% yet (I know Russ will get it 100% soon) he did an amazing job on the theme. Already have had several people comment on how clean and amazing it looks. If you are looking for someone to make a custom theme for you I highly recommend Russ/PixelExit. They go above and...<br />
