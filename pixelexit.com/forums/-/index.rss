      <content:encoded><![CDATA[So i was thinking that the small holiday joy addon could do with a small upgrade, one that includes different events for the year.<br />
<br />
it should include<br />
-Christmas (which is already does)<br />
-Halloween<br />
-Easter<br />
-Thanks Giving<br />
-Birthday<br />
-New year<br />
<br />
I think that having cool images like the holiday joy one around the year would be a nice addition to any forum.]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[I purchased this today on Thanksgiving,  but I&#039;m not sure I can use this in it&#039;s current state.<br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t realize how bare bones it is. <br />
<br />
Top reasons I can&#039;t use this now:<br />
<br />
1. Have to manually build each field AND manually add users. I&#039;m basically duplicating the Member list by hand. Solution:  There needs to be a syncing feature with the member list and/or a way to automatically add users when they are added to a user group. <br />
<br />
2. Users need a way to enter info.]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Working the same as Teamspeak Intigration, Discord Intigration would have all the same features, just use a much different API.<br />
<br />
Discord is putting the nuce around Teamspeaks neck because they are completely free, have much more complete android, iphone, and even blackberry apps. Use IRC chat for seperatly integrating, into other software, like twitch and minecraft servers. And have a much easier to use permission system. All this for FREE.<br />
<br />
I have already paid for the TS Integration but...<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[A lot of the tickets we get are by guests who have trouble with the registration process. It is already possible to allow guests to open tickets. But when they register there will be an account with the same email. The software should connect the ticket to the registered account.]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello, so i am new to XenForo, i am about to purchase a license actually very soon! I have been going through themes, audentio and pixelexit themes to be precise, both makers really good. But i love PixelExit themes a bit more! I have been wanting to start a gaming &quot;clan&quot; or &quot;guild&quot; as you may know it! So far i love XenForo for a forum structure and love PixelExit themes! A ton of the themes will actually fit with the clans image! Thats why i love pixel exit!<br />
