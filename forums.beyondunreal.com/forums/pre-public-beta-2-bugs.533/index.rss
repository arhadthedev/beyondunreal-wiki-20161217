<br />
I am new to UTXMP even though I do hang around in the BU forums from time to time. First, I would like to thank Free Monkey for reviving U2XMP in such high quality -- well done there! I somehow prefer it over Onslaught, since it has more items and more tactics.<br />

I decided to have a go at a German translation (<i>ucc dumpint</i> being a loyal friend), and I am far enough. Unfortunately, some of the strings are forced-English. An example is...<br />

Secondly, the bullet cause quiet some momentum to vehicles (at least the raptor) It should be toned down imo. It is just a bullet after all.<br />

Luckily for me, i prefer the Tech class over Ranger and Gunner. <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" alt=":p" title="Stick Out Tongue    :p" />]]></content:encoded>

what the bug/exploit does is it allows you to get the zoom of a sniper rifle with any other Ranger weapon.<br />
<br />
exact steps:<br />
1) pick ranger class<br />
2) select sniper rifle<br />
3) fire 1 or 2 shots off (doesn&#039;t matter where)<br />
4) hit reload after 1-2 shots have been expended<br />
5) right after you hit reload use mousewheel or hit 2-5 to select another weapon <br />
6) the sniper rifle will get done...<br />
