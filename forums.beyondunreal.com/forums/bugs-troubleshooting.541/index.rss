      <content:encoded><![CDATA[I know this has been brought up before and I have already read the faqs. However there is a transparentcy bug on the unexpected map. I haven&#039;t found it on any other map but this one. At first when I read all the info before playing the first thing I thought of was sniper. But after talking with the person who was nice enough to greet me to the server. I found out he was a mechanic. Everytime I killed him he would come back running at me shooting and being transparent. That is most assuredly...<br />
