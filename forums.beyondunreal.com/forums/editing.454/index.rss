Submission 1:<br />

Got the stuff inside the store and tweaked some of the exterior colors. The signs and strips on the building pulse, hence the different colors in each shot. Lighting could still use some tweaking, but I&#039;ll save that for another time.<br />
<br />
Note: The interior is pure deco (player can not get inside, but they can run around and on top of the building)....<br />

<br />
i managed to download the mod, after trying for about half a year (i finally realized how to use a download manager <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" alt=";)" title="Wink    ;)" /> )<br />
<br />
My question is, if someone can tell me how to build an own car. I already made a model with uv and textures and i know how to import it into ut04 as a static mesh or as an animated mesh. <br />
I already imported it as a replacement of an existing car, and got it into the game. But there are some problems: <br />

I recently downloaded this mod, and have loved it so far. I like the Urban Static Meshes and Textures so much, that I would like to know if I could use them in an Assault mapping project. I will not get paid for it, and this might end up on a server, so I just wanted to know. If so I can give the members a copy of this map, I will put the needed copyrights in the description, and anything else.<br />

Cool mod! I am interested in doing a mod involving cars and want to achieve the car selection screen and spawn in the car that you guys have achieved. I would greatly appreciate some help from those in the know if they could point me in the direction of achieving this. <br />

I have looked on wiki&#039;s and other forums and thus far have achieved spawning in a small level in a car pre determined in UED with a PlayerSpawnManager. I want to go beyond that and select the car ingame like you...<br />
