Remember the console command <br />

(g.e.: <i>set tmale2 health 499</i>)<br />
<br />
which allows to increase one classes health and such also beyond spawning.  <br />
To get the classnames open UED and browse actors/pawns. <br />

As mentioned to SaD a long while ago, Skin City are welcome to use #A2.Gaming as their IRC channel because it didn&#039;t have one of its own.<br />
<br />
I intend for #Vexel to be a large gaming/social community and we&#039;re already in the middle of designing the website so as a long term fan of Skin City, once again I&#039;m offering you to use #Vexel as your IRC Quakenet...<br />
