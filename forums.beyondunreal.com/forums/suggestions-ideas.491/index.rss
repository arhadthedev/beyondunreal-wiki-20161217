      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello im here to give you guys some suggestion on how to balance some weapons and fix some ones :<br />
<br />
<span style="color: Red">First the Mechanic Class</span> :<br />
<br />
Give their pistol ( i guess its P228) less recoil ( 20-40% less)  and faster firing speed ( like 30 or 20% more) but always keep the medic/other pistols faster)<br />
<br />
Shotgun : it should decap 3 monsters like Killing Floor ( to be more realistic) how a shotgun is supposed to be (killing monsters en masse)<br />
<br />
Medic Class :<br />
Pistol  : ok i guess ,...<br />

<br />
On the maps with mortar raining down (which is a fair amount, Siege, Triumph, and that city one all come to mind immediately), it&#039;s hugely annoying to be killed right after spawning. For example, on Siege, I was defending and kept respawning on top of the castle. That&#039;d be fine, except that area is under constant mortar fire and there&#039;s no way to choose your spawn point. Sooo I ended up being...<br />

2.  More weapons. Couple kinds of assault rifles, couple kinds of SMGs, and a couple types of pistols.  Is there already a sniper rifle?  A flamethrower wouldn&#039;t hurt either. <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" alt=";)" title="Wink    ;)" /><br />

This would also make the gameplay a little more interesting as it would allow for maps that are very heavily fortified, howeer the teams could be 1 - 4 in favour of the...<br />

What I would like to see is some disadvantages to leaving a turret unmanned.<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li> <b>Slower tracking</b> - The turret rotates slower than it would manned, so that if a player is within 96 units of it they can strafe around it faster then it can rotate. (to get behind it)</li>

- The little machine gun for the Anti-armor guy should be a little bit more powerfull and accurate<br />
- MX-40 pistol should be a little bit more powerfull (not a lot)<br />
- Medic should be abble to heal more faster <br />
- Dont touch the grenade at all...they are good just like this<br />
