      <content:encoded><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure if this is still an active forum but I&#039;ll post anyway and hopeI can get an answer.<br />
<br />
I do maps for Truff&#039;s (<a href="http://www.truff.net" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">www.truff.net</a>) and recently I created a portal map on a dedicated server that people can use as a gateway to the other servers. I decided to update the map and give it real time server stats for all the servers it has access to. Screen 131 is the perfect solution but I&#039;ve run into a technical difficulty maybe.<br />
I need to run stats for 9 servers. I created to...<br />

If, however, i start a server and click dedicated, then join it, the server query does not work. This problem occurs on my server aswell as i have the Dedicated version of UT server installed as opposed to the whole game - so that i need not use graphics.<br />

Why is it that screen server query isnt functioning in dedicated...<br />

How about if I used a scriptedscreen.utx texture on a prefab, made it into a mesh with Meshmaker (tm) <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie8" alt=":D" title="Big Grin    :D" />  and used it in my level, added a screen actor and my desired ssranking/ssmap/ssweb... would this work?  (I&#039;m talking just one surface on a mesh, nothing stupid)<br />

DAMN NICE really REALLY nice idea<br />

now my only wish list would be some way of changing the &quot;alignment&quot; of the screen in game.. what i mean is the most time consuming part ive found is setting up the screen actor to have the right dimensions and centering the slide correctly<br />

would it be possible to have say a mutator or...<br />

I would have had to scribble out a diagram of what goes on at some point anyway to understand the relationships between the different elements -- as it is I&#039;ve made it in Freehand so it&#039;s nice &amp; neat &amp; everyone can appreciate it <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /><br />

I may have got it completely wrong -- if Mychaeel corrects my inept mistakes I&#039;ll be happy to make corrections <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" />]]></content:encoded>
