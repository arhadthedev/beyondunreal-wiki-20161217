You go with a Moscowboy beside the enemy&#039;s Clone Jars and take a Clone Jar and dropp it with the Moscowboy.<br />
Then you repeat this several times.The bots won&#039;t come and return all Clone Jars you dropped.<br />
Is it possible to make a Script for preventing that one rides with a Clone Jar on a Moscowboy?]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[the first one has only happened to me online and when i was playing on the clown server i think.  What happens is, sometimes a pump that is controlled by a team has no color, although it shows correctly on the map.  However it is still attackable or defendable, depending on your team.  just in case its a vid card problem i have a geforce 4 mx 440.<br />

2nd bug<br />
<br />
I apologize in advance for the lack of screenies.  that said, there are a couple spots on the map where you can go up to a wall...<br />
