      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Reciprocity has gone ahead and asked about a private forum at <a href="http://www.unrealsp.org" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">UnrealSP.org</a>.  It&#039;s possible to do, but we need 5 active members, minimum, in order to set it up.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[The following is a (more or less) comprehensive list (including descriptions) of ALL groups involved at some point in Devastation.  As always, this info is debatable.<br />
<br />
It takes a lot of time to write detailed histories, so it&#039;s likely that all the groups listed won&#039;t be written about (yet).<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Since the private forum doesn&#039;t exist (and I have serious doubts that it ever will), I guess all the info and ideas passed around is public, but even so...<br />
<br />
This is what I intend to have as the public storyline.  This will be, esentially, what the player knows before even starting a new mission.<br />
<br />
This original post is what was in the last team-wide e-mail.  It is posted here for reference and refinement.<br />
