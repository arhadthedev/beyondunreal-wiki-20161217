      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Well been playing a lot of DA2 and enjoying it a lot, however there is one thing that gets me quite annoyed. There always seems to be a large amount of bot snipers, not only are there a lot of them but they dont seem to suffer the same recoil disadvantages we do. As such when defending it is practically impossible to set up any turrets when under attack and even if they can only see the very top of your head they still seem to hit almost every time when you are standing still.<br />

So i guess...<br />

good points:<br />
<br />
- awesome presentation, menus, sounds, graphics<br />
- the mini zoom feature on some guns is brilliant, and the rocket camera is too!<br />
- weapons feel good to use!<br />
- gameplay is addictive... played for about an hour, was gonna do something else but had me coming back for another couple!<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[I was just thinking...there are so many changes being implemented, that you may want to go beyond the name 1.1.<br />
 <br />
I think the sheer length of the change log should justify at least a &quot;beta 2.0&quot; designation.<br />
 <br />
To the outside community that will further accentuate how much has changed (which is...A LOT!), whereas, a 1.1 release sounds like a simple update and it may not draw much of a crowd.<br />

Just a thought...<br />

About a month before DA2 was released I started working on a beach assault map and currently I think it&#039;s not looking too bad but needs alot of work, but anyways, I was wondering how long it would be before vehicles are released because I&#039;m almost done with the map and I don&#039;t want to wait for vehicles to come out before I release. But anyways, since I mentioned it I&#039;ll show you guys my map. (BTW - Personally I&#039;m sick <img src="styles/smilies/chainsaw.gif" class="mceSmilie" alt=":chainsaw:" title="Chainsaw    :chainsaw:" /> of seing this map so I&#039;d really like to release it...<br />
