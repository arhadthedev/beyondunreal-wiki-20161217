      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi there,<br />
<br />
Sorry to see Duffers has got sooo little support from the &#039;community&#039; <img src="styles/smilies/laugh.gif" class="mceSmilie" alt=":lol:" title="Laugh    :lol:" /> <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" alt=";)" title="Wink    ;)" /> Pure slackness <img src="styles/smilies/laugh.gif" class="mceSmilie" alt=":lol:" title="Laugh    :lol:" />  <br />
<br />
Anyway, I think Duffers is pretty cool and 99% faultless <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /><br />
<br />
It&#039;s inspired me to have a go at modelling,, hehe,, I can now make pretty tidy and accurate golf landscapes <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie8" alt=":D" title="Big Grin    :D" /> Yeah yeah i kinda understand the tutorial and stuff <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /> <br />
<br />
I look forward to seeing what comes forth from the Coil stable in the long term <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" alt=";)" title="Wink    ;)" /> Keep up the good work (even if its nothing to do with Duffers)...<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Where can I find more maps/courses to play. The game seems fun, but the same 9 holes get boring fast.<br />
Also, I can&#039;t seem to find any servers. Any chance the Duffer&#039;s team might host a deadicated server that will show up in the browser? I tried hosting a game but after an hour I was tired of waiting for someone to join.<br />
One more thing.... <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" alt=":rolleyes:" title="Roll Eyes    :rolleyes:" /> I think it might be kindda&#039; cool if we had the opption of useing the UT skins for our players, along with the nomal skins.<br />

Found the power meter really difficult to use - don&#039;t know if its just me but alot of times the shot didn&#039;t work - my third click was obviously too far away from 0% to be counted.  Even if its really bad couldn&#039;t you just make it count with very low accuracy.  At 100% power I was only...<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[I know in a 32 player game this would be absurd, but I have mostly been playing with a groups of 3-4 people.......most of us are wondering if you are going to show other people golfing. Most golf games I have played let you spectate as others play their turn, then it cycles through the turns again.<br />

I would really like to see this feature added as an option at least.<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Sorry I didn&#039;t comment on the closed beta.  But a lot has been cleaned up since the 2003 version so maybe it&#039;s better this way.<br />
<br />
In general the shot system seems to be well in place.  Great job guys!<br />
<br />
My suggestions:<br />
<br />
Shots don&#039;t go nearly as far as advertised.  A driver claims to go 273 at max power but I&#039;ve never shot the ball farther than 240 off the tee.  If I didn&#039;t know my clubs better (too much Golden Tee) I would use the &quot;suggested&quot; clubs and shoot much worse.  My observations:...<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Just a quick suggestion for the marker that shows where you&#039;re aiming the ball. It ought to resize itself as it gets further away (smaller) and larger as it gets closer to make it abundantly clear what its function is (I thought it was simply pointing in the direction you were shooting for quite awhile). The distance/club could stay with static-sized text.]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Ok, this mod is pretty fun and a great start.  In my opinion though, your models need some work.  Either to look more realistic or to go for more of an animated style.  The models as they are now I dont feel look good enough.  In my opinion I&#039;d go animated style, but from what the models are now it looks like your going realistic.  So just my suggestion.  Best of luck with this mod]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Have this displayed so that one can switch to another mod easily, or add some means to return to normal UT2004. If i feel like a round of golf while playing UT2k4, i can just switch to it on the community menu, but the reverse is not currently possible.<br />

Great job guys! one other little detail, could you set some BGM music for the map?]]></content:encoded>

It&#039;d definitely help beginners on the golfcourse.<br />
<br />
An overhead &#039;radar&#039;-view of the map would help as well.<br />

Of course this should be selected by the clients/players themselves ...]]></content:encoded>

My thought is to port one or more of the maps into DM, CTF, vCTF (with golf carts ;-) ) etc and have a map designer alter what is needed to make the map playable in one of these game plays, even possibly using a map designer outside the Golf devolopment team so not to slow the mod production down.
