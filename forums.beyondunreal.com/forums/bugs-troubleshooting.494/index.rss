      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Okay, i cant find anywhere in 1.7 readme or on the site of how to actually start the game. Its not under gametypes in practice, not under multiplayer, and in the DA folder i cant see any exe or bat file to start it. Its not under the mod menu or anything.<br />
So how do i even start it??<br />
I used the final of course, in zip format, and extracted to D:/UnrealTournament (which is my directory)]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi all<br />
i&#039;m having troubles launching this on the Mac - can anyone help!<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve installed DA from the full/1.7 zip version and the DA folder is in the root of UT along with the rest of this install. All done.  Ok, so how do i launch this app on the Mac?<br />
<br />
Just by launching UT, i can play on the DA maps by the looks of it, but i&#039;ve got the normal UT weapon plus the textures don&#039;t look right compared to the screenshots i&#039;ve seen at this website.. hmm, ok, i&#039;m guessing to scrap the DA folder...<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi, I&#039;ve installed the DA1.7 CE and launched.I was surprised of the speed-it runned very slow when playing intro.So I pressed esc and waited. The processor <br />
and HDD seemed to work hard, but still nothing happened, so I had to close it after few minutes by ctrl-alt-delete.I tried it several times, but it didn&#039;t help. What should I do?]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been having a major problem recently, with the source release on FilePlanet. It says in the Readme.txt to place DAData.u in the UT\System directory if you get compile errors for missing data/files/etc but, it doesn&#039;t work. The Source won&#039;t compile because it&#039;s not finding the model data in DAData.u to show the weapons. I&#039;ve been able to get it to compile however by editing out the DAData information, but now I&#039;m stuck as to how to get the meshes to work right and show up for the default...<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Its always great to get fan mail, and I thought I would share this one with everyone.<br />
<br />
<i>Hi, eagerly awaiting the release of Defense Alliance 2 (actually,<br />
impatiently!) I went out and bought the original Unreal Tournament just to play Defence Alliance while we endure the long wait.<br />
Downloaded the final release (1.7) and I&#039;m having a bit of a problem getting any bots in the game. I read the FAQ and it said you can spawn bots to defend with you, however I haven&#039;t found an option to do so....</i><br />
