Just thinking though, it&#039;s not what I, personally, would envision as fitting for Uskaarj. Not that it&#039;s not good enough, that it just seems sorta the wrong style IMHO. <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" />]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Every RTS player can tell you this. After a long match (and specially frantic ones) Resources simply run out. Also, a lame tactic I&#039;ve seen is to simply &quot;outresource&quot; the enemy (Defend until the enemy has no more resources).<br />
<br />
Command and Conquer&#039;s tiberium regenerates over time.<br />
Dark Reign&#039;s Taleon has the option of regenerate Taleon wells.<br />
Battlezone 2 has unlimited resources in every biometal pool.<br />
Empire Earth has an obscene amount of resources in every mine(300,000 each or so)....<br />

What I&#039;m trying to ask is, is there going to be FPS(Like commandos could be actual players)?  If not, then this is a suggestion. It would attract a lot of fans, because of the nice teamplay possibility .(dont need the field filled with players, only a few in the form of commandos <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" alt=";)" title="Wink    ;)" /> .]]></content:encoded>
