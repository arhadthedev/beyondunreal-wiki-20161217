I see lots of &quot;This Site&quot; and &quot;Miscellaneous&quot; subforums.  There&#039;s some &quot;Comment on Games/Reviews/etc&quot;.

Am I missing something?  Should I just move along to the next site?]]></content:encoded>

<br />
I&#039;ve already posted this on the beyondunreal forums, but i hope some people who are into this site may be interested in starting up a new review site. I would happily like to revive this site if possible, because it would save time instead of me finding/coding php scripts and such, although i will change things such as the site.<br />
<br />
If anyone is interested in reviewing Mods, Maps, mutators etc, please don&#039;t hesitate to post here<br />
<br />
Thank You<br />

onto the homesite.  Too bad it is no longer being worked on, as it has a<br />
couple of serious bugs (I&#039;m using Windows XP Pro, BTW):<br />
<br />
1.   The turrets don&#039;t work at all, and<br />
<br />
2.   There is a &quot;freeze&quot; bug which causes player pawns (bots and humans)<br />
