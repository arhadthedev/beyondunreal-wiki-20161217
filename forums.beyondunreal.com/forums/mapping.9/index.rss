      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi, a while ago I found in Properties either in Level Properties or wherever that  you can add a Mutator to a level/Map and it works with only that Map.<br />
<br />
I have been looking for it again but I&#039;ve lost it in UnrealEd 2.0 (UT2k4) and it&#039;s frustrating. I checked all the &quot;View&quot; properties but I know it&#039;s in there somewhere, I&#039;ve used it before but ages ago so forgot.<br />
<br />
Does anybody know where it is in UnrealEd 2.0?<br />
<br />
It&#039;s basically an easy fix to remove the ShieldGun and AssaultRifle from the game...<br />

<br />
I am interested in mapping for the new UT (which I will henceforth call UT4). I wanted to ask any of you guys or gals who has had experience with it some basic questions:<br />
<br />
1) Does UT4 utilize the latest, ever-evolving version of Unreal Engine 4 (at the time of this post version 4.8), or has it stuck with a certain branch? I ask this to avoid learning stuff for general UE4 and then finding different features in UT4.<br />
<br />
2) Are there any good tutorials to get started with mapping?...<br />

When I went into UnrealEd to open up my map again, it was corrupted, nothing showed up. I may be missing a texture pack, but is there anything I can do to try to salvage it? It&#039;s been bugging me for over 6 years that I never finished the map.<br />

I&#039;ve attached the file, does anybody know what I...<br />
