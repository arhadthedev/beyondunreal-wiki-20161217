Is there a future for this style of play anymore? I felt like the original UT, for me, captured a few unique things:<br />

With UT2003/4, things really started to get rather techy. UT3 was kind of odd because Epic apparently was going through their &quot;dark and gritty&quot; phase. Either way though, it still really had a sci-fi theme to it. Once we got to UT3, it seemed like all elements of fantasy and wonder and surrealism kind of... Vanished from the series.<br />

UT3&#039;s was a little on the slower side, in keeping with the befuddling shockrifle nerfs that happened from UT2003 onward.<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi,<br />
Its been years siince I played any kind of gaming and so have now dug out my UT2K4 and have a friend who has their version on a laptop.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve looked for 2 days now but can&#039;t find a guide of how I can setup the 2 games so we can play each other directly through my home WiFi.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m useless at this kind of stuff and have no idea if I need to open a port on my router, or how to setup the game to play direct through my home network - or even if it can be done?<br />
<br />
I&#039;d appreciate any help if you...<br />
<br />
