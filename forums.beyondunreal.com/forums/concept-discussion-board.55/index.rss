Of course, it needs a bit more substance than that. Perhaps it could be an elaborate betting game, where you bet on different teams in an area. Or perhaps thats a stupid idea.<br />
<br />
Maybe the player could direct his team of Krall. He could click on one, then click somewhere else to order them...<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Ok, I am creating a weapon, and i have most of the model done.  It is the Arc Rod.  Can be configured with the Super Arc Rod for Insta-Gib like games. <br />
<br />
Here&#039;s the idea: <br />
<br />
Hold down primary fire to deliver a stream of supercharged electricity.  It wont drain ammo unless you touch someone with it.  It delivers constant damage when you are firing and touching someone.  No more whack-with-the-shieldgun.  Instead, creep up behind that sniper and fry him!<br />
<br />
Secondary fire slowly recharges...<br />
