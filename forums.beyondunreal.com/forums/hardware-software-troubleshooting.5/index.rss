      <content:encoded><![CDATA[So I&#039;ll be compiling a new system, probably this month. Perhaps in January, but preferably this year.<br />
<br />
Basically I&#039;ll be looking for a new mobo, processor, ram, gpu, psu, hdd (solid state drives f.e and backup.) and a case.<br />
What I have in mind is a pretty powerfull machine. I want to try some of the recent games, but the main purpose will be graphics editing. I need lots and lots of memory.  I&#039;ve bought a graphics tablet (wacom bamboo) a while ago and want to enjoy it to the fullest extent....<br />

<br />
Anyone else had any issues? I don&#039;t know if its an old driver, or an out of date driver so I will be going over all of them and updating them when I next get in front of my PC. <br />
