I don&#039;t host any files or upload hardly any, but for the people that do this must suck big time. I can see a lot of old UT99/UT2004/UT3 maps and mods just disappearing completely if not hosted somewhere else. It&#039;s a good thing I&#039;m almost done downloading what I want.<br />

Now this sounds very much like the Fury in UT3. Ok, I tend to find funny similarities but just think about it: same name, alien (Necris?) origins, weapon of same style, ability to do speed boosts. And it&#039;s made of special strain of Bio-metal while the UT...<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Repost from Epic Forums but yeah I still play this game and its annoying it crashes on startup now. <br />
<br />
So seemingly out of nowhere, my UT3 crashes on startup. This is incredibly odd as it never used to do this before. I just updated my video drivers and tried verifying integrity on Steam so neither of those is the problem. It must have something to do with the Kernelbase.dll not being found in the log because its never crashed on startup before.<br />
<br />
<br />
    If anyone has any idea how to fix this...<br />
