Any readers of BuF should be aware that I do not enjoy UT3 and never enjoyed it at any period over the months I had it installed. I kept hoping Epic would patch it up quickly and its issues would subside and the game would be great fun, but that never happened. I recently uninstalled the game and unless Epic can fix it up I will not reinstall.<br />
<br />
So, let&#039;s get to the point: I am resigning from Insite. It&#039;s...</div><div class="quoteExpand">Click to expand...</div></blockquote>

<br />
I stumbled upon this in the Beyond Unreal UT2k4 forum, and absolutely had to post here to spread the word! UT2k4 is not dead at all! A guy named Motig has started Ut2004 Rebirth, a working pickup channel and ladders for all UT2k4 gamemodes, every day we play different game mode. Gameservers are hosted in northern Europe.<br />
<br />
Currently the pickup schedule is:<br />
Mon: Assault<br />
Tue: NW Bombing Run<br />
Wed: Classic Domination...<br />
