<br />
I have some basic Pre-Caching questions and I hope some of you might know the answers to them.<br />
<br />
1) I know that precaching is used to Exclusively to &quot;store&quot; Resources in RAM memory, in order to decrease loading time.<br />
Does that mean that Pre-Caching only reduces loading time, or It may also &quot;speed up&quot; the game during play?<br />
EXAMPLE: Lets say we have two vehicles, or some other objects (doesn&#039;t really matter) that are going to spawn during play. Each vehicle has one texture (skin)....<br />
