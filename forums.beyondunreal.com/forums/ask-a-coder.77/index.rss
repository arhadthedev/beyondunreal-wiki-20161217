      <content:encoded><![CDATA[I&#039;ve always been one that has fun playing around with the Unreal summoning system on single player, and was always able to summon various NPC&#039;s, weapons and projectiles on classic Unreal/Unreal Gold, but on Unreal II it got extra fun when I discovered I could summon the 3 marine styles as friendly allies and their personalities. I was wondering, is there a way to get the marines from Unreal II imported into Unreal Gold for summoning, and still retain their qualities? Been curious about this...<br />
