      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey there,<br />
<br />
review not to shabby... the score seems low for that quality of a map I would have expected 7-7.5, 6 was kind of harsh.... <br />
<br />
I dont think its set in stone that BR has to been in open spaces...  <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" alt=":eek:" title="Eek!    :eek:" /><br />
<br />
about the ball being on the lower level...well it is compensated by jumpads next to it to grab the ball and go back up and keep running or jump down and grab the ball and run the lower route<br />
<br />
thats my thoughts...but hey I guess its your review your opinion...everyone is...<br />

Things to keep in mind:<br />
<br />
1. It&#039;s about 40.1 MB zipped and about 75.6 MB unzipped!<br />
<br />
2. It&#039;s substantially longer than any AS map before it, taking on average 15-25 minutes to complete, so make usre to adjust your round timers to ccomodate it!]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[I played a map years ago back in 1999-2000 that had a giant staircase like a mile up with sniper rifles and ammo at the top. There was a transporter at the bottom that transported you to the top of the staircase sniper area, right in the back of the sniper (the first person that made it to the top of the staircase), we would race eachother to the top to be the first one up so we can do &quot;headshots&quot; on everyone else trying to get up.<br />

<br />
DM-CloudConnected &gt;&gt; interesting, small, good architecture, good rockin&#039; tune, I like the addition of the sniper nest and don&#039;t fall.<br />
DM-Fotze &gt;&gt; interesting and small duel map, good lighting and edges, nice ambient sounds and effects. No problem getting items and weapons in this one.<br />
DM-Mindkiller &gt;&gt; good one! ramps and goo everywhere!...<br />

Anyone trying to DL UT maps from Insite reviews just has to make sure &quot;dl.php&quot; is linked in the PHP part of the URL and that &quot;insite/ut&quot; also appears somewhere in the link. Sometimes the beginning part needs to have &quot;www.beyondunreal.com&quot; or &quot;insite.beyondunreal.com&quot; also. I believe any UT map...<br />

On this map I tried out a lot new stuff. It&#039;s an Onslaught battle but there is no terrain e.g.<br />
Further I worked with some interesting technics like physics, new vehicles and monsters and embedded them into the map. <br />
At last there is only one single file needed to play the map. <br />

Basic layout seems good. I like the architechture... neo-apocalyptica allways looks good in UT, ey ^_^ GREAT intro!<br />

The first flaw I did notice was the utter LACK of vehicles. This map is fronted as a vehicle-centric map, but the assaulters don&#039;t initially have access to very many vehicles other than a few Mantas and a couple of Scorpions, easy prey for the Defense. This makes the initial...<br />

<br />
This is my first released map for Unreal Tournament 2004. (released in July) It is a remake of a Q3A map by the same name otherwise known as charon3dm3. It is a small death match map that is suitable for 1on1 but the layout will hold many more. Once at the burial-grounds Q3A server we had a 40+ frag fest on the original. It&#039;s intended to be a tribute to the original yet complement the enhanced game play...<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[It was suggested we start a forum thread on this topic, so here it is. Everyone on the Team feel free to cut and paste from the pre-comments for DM-1on1-Mosaic2004.<br />
<br />
It just defies all logic that&#039;s all. If a map IS truly a 1on1 map, the default bot load should be 1. You can make your 1on1 maps and big as you want, but if the default bot load is not 1 then the 1on1 should be left out of the title. I know a lot of mappers do it, but that doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s right. I&#039;m sorry if I offend anyone,...<br />
