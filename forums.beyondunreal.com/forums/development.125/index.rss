Hope you still visit these forums regularly.<br />
I&#039;m wondering if it would be possible to attach a screen to a flag texture.<br />
I&#039;ve already used custom flag textures and I&#039;m wondering if there&#039;s a way to add something like a camera to it. So if your flag has been taken you&#039;d beable to see where your flag is by looking at the opposing teams flag.]]></content:encoded>

Wondering if you could help with with switching through textures upon hitting a button.  I have downloaded and setup the screen modification and was hoping someone could lay out a few steps for me.  <br />
<br />
Im wanting to first change some already installed textures into scripted textures and then be able to switch through a few while in the game via a trigger.<br />

Any help would be appreciated.<br />
