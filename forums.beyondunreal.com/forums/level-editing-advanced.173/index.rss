<br />
I made a screenshot of my map:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://convictionofdestiny.webs.com/screenshot.gif" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">http://convictionofdestiny.webs.com/screenshot.gif</a><br />
<a href="http://convictionofdestiny.webs.com/screenshot.pcx" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">http://convictionofdestiny.webs.com/screenshot.pcx</a><br />

<br />
I&#039;m just wondering how you make a mover which has 0+1+2+3 keys and stops in each one of them for two seconds? I&#039;ve tried many ways but couldn&#039;t make it work. Figured out myself how to make all the keys work (NumKeys 4).<br />
But I do not know how to make the mover stop in each one of them. Something like my room + mover below.<br />

I&#039;m going to ask you some advice about these three points:<br />
- First of all, I was trying to realize a decent effect for a kind of Burning Sphere. I tried with a custom fire texture on a volumetric brush, but the effect isn&#039;t really what I wanted to. Maybe a mesh? (but I don&#039;t know how to make one...)<br />
- Then... there will be a column which will show &quot;souls&quot; crossing...<br />

I managed to make a triggered one, but in this case it just turns the ZoneInfo on and leaves it on, no matter if you try to use the trigger again.

<br />
This thing I&#039;m working on has differently themed areas, and me and my &#039;beta team&#039; think it&#039;d be wonderful to have different music tracks in each &#039;zone&#039;. We know we can use triggers to turn on different music tracks, but i&#039;m sure a file with 8 or 9 different tracks of music is going to be huge.<br />
<br />
Is there any other convinient way to accomplish this in a map?]]></content:encoded>
