<br />
I need help with some custom audio I&#039;m recording.  Just a few questions.<br />
<br />
Question 1:  When initially recording a sound, can I just use the Sound Recorder program?  Do i need a specific recording program to be compatible with UT2k4?<br />
<br />
Question 2:  How do I import sounds into Unreal?  I know it needs to be a .umx file (or something like that) and then I need to compile it (or something like that), but can I just change the...<br />

So when I was just working I thought it would be cool if we could make the keypads on the wall work and when peepz enter the right code the door would open. Now you see I&#039;m not a coder so I would need help with this.]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Greetings, all!<br />
<br />
From my mapping days (and some more recent stuff), I come bearing tips to mappers of all levels.  I am by no means perfect (as much as I tell myself, anyways <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" alt=":p" title="Stick Out Tongue    :p" />), so if somebody has some new/better tips, by all means, post and share them<br />
<br />

i got the ladder to work well enough but when i go down them the player gets stuck, also i kinda need lighting suggestions for the map Base, the larger rooms have no light sources and as an artist that bugs the crap out of me.<br />
