The scammers called me and said they were from my bank, and asked me to log into my bank account to check some unusual activity. A little odd, but not so crazy. <br />

So I said i would, but then hung up. Then called up the fraud department from my bank, and asked if someone had just called me regarding my account. They didn&#039;t know anything of it, and said it was likely a scammer. <br />

Has anyone ever had this? It was new to me.]]></content:encoded>

Nobody calls Superman a monster... well, nobody that isn&#039;t Lex Luthor.<br />

<br />
The data the hacker gained access to includes: your email, date of birth and password which we know was only an MD5 of an MD5+SALT of your password which means there is a chance your password has been decrypted.<br />

If you use the same password in other locations, especially your email account it is suggested you change your password as quickly as possible.<br />

It&#039;s not that multiplayer games didn&#039;t exist before 1999. They absolutely did. But in 1999, games went from including multiplayer as an afterthought because it was complicated to configure and use to being a primary focus and the selling point of many games.

Couple of quick observations:<br />
- chainsaw seems a bit too powerfull?<br />
- There&#039;s no need for a slowdown when you switch to another weapon<br />
- As a nice nostalgic wink; include an optional statusbar (or just the face) someone could probably, if possible, mod that in. <br />
But it&#039;s still early; Realse if I&#039;m not mistaken would be for spring next year.]]></content:encoded>
