<br />
I am a newbie to unreal scripting, so sorry if these questions are obviuos to some of you. <br />

I have two very simple environments, and strangely the joystick behaves differently in the two environments. Specifically, the rotation (look left/right) is much faster in one environment than in the other. I tinkered a bit with the User.ini file in the systems folder, where I changed &quot;SpeedBase&quot; in the line <br />
<br />
JoyX=Axis aBaseX = SpeedBase=2.0 DeadZone=0.4<br />
<br />
This affects the turning speed...<br />

<br />
alright so a little about me. i am currently a student and im pursueing a degree in game design. <br />
now what interests me most is character modeling.<br />
then today my teacher made it very clear that its hard to get a job in the industry as a character artist.<br />
hence i realised that its a good idea to explore other fields as fall backs. <br />
then someone suggested learning to use the UDK and or UE3?<br />
but then that raised a few questions like<br />
can i import my models and textures...<br />
