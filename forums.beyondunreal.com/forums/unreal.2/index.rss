      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Has anyone ever stopped to consider that the main reason there&#039;s such conflict between humans &amp; Skaarj is that we call them <i>monsters</i>? I mean, they&#039;re really just aliens. Non-human beings from other planets.<br />
<br />
Nobody calls Superman a monster... well, nobody that isn&#039;t Lex Luthor.<br />
<br />
Sure, there&#039;s been a lot of conflict with the Skaarj and sure... they kinda like eating humans, but can&#039;t we just get past that?<br />

Can&#039;t we all just get along??]]></content:encoded>

You can scale them to your liking using pepakura Designer (you see the dimensions in there) and apply different textures I included if you want. All the evolutions of the Dispersion Pistol are also included! They are are scaled properly towards each other, but not the other instructables.<br />

<br />
The (in)famous 1995 Unreal Gargoyle finished up for release. I wanted to preserve this for when I release the next part of the Unreal PSX rework, but realistically that&#039;s still gonna take a while. So here you go, enjoy.]]></content:encoded>
