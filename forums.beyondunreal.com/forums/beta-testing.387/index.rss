      <content:encoded><![CDATA[First of all USkaarj team: Awesome work. It&#039;s truely genious what you pulled off, turning a FPS into a RTS game. It&#039;d be a shame to see USkaarj for UT discontinued because of UT2003/2004. But maybe you let other<br />
people make mods for the original UT based on the USkaarj code?<br />
<br />
The interface is cool and I&#039;m accustomed with it after having tried things out for a few minutes. <img src="styles/smilies/2thumbs.gif" class="mceSmilie" alt=":2thumb:" title="Two Thumbs    :2thumb:" /><br />
The whole mod looks superb IMHO. <img src="styles/smilies/notworthy.gif" class="mceSmilie" alt=":notworthy:" title="Notworthy    :notworthy:" /><br />

i was thinking..this could go retail if you fixed a bit.  im sure some company wants a RTS in this engine <br />

im actually wondeirng about if your adidng fog of war <br />

Another thing I saw was that Uskaarj.ini took alot of keys from other mods. (shown in red)These are useless in Uskaarj and maybe causing the bugs.<br />
Shown below are some of the commands taken from other mods ini.<br />
Note: there are many more commands in there from INF and UT. Notice grab, an...<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[First of all, it&#039;s a very nice mod but it obviously still needs some work. Here are the points I have:<br />
<br />
- Zooming  over the map works OK most of the time, but it only seemed to work on my own buildings and on the tyridium.<br />
<br />
- This game really needs a manual that describes the possibilities. I had barnEbiss telling me how to group units and how to zoom the map and how to move around, but he will probably not always be around <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /><br />

- I need some tooltips on the icons in the lower right...<br />

1: Try to give us a mini-map, i went out to find the enemy base and got lost=\<br />
2:know the top down/top onm an angle veiw in other RTS&#039;s? If possible I&#039;d love ot see that,if not this veiw is pretty good.3: in the &quot;crossing&quot; map, i couldnt see the type cause the white sky ahd blocked it,and i couldnt pick NEG.<br />
<br />
it was fun, tohugh i need to try it on a better server(devi&#039;s was laggy, no offence)<br />
