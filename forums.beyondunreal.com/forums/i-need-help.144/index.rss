<br />
I am making a single-player MOD for UT2004 (Occupant17, its got a post in Content Releases)<br />

I am a mapper, and after trying to understand others&#039; MOD principles I am so lost.<br />
<br />
It will be my first Community MOD and I looked for some sort of tutorial but found I usually got a 404 because UT2004 is old.<br />
<br />
I am adding to UT2004, 3369 version:<br />

A new Intro Movie (new NvidiaLogo)<br />
.ut2 map files (how do you turn them into different classes as in DM, CTF etc..?)<br />
New Logo and new...<br />
