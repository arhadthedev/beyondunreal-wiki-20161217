I&#039;m a young mapper looking for a possible side project from my work, at a small console developer, as we&#039;re waiting for our next project. I&#039;ve been following this project since August of last year and it is undoubtedly the most stellar work being done in unreal engine to date. I was hoping I might be able to help you out with some mapping (I remember a request before on the Atari Forums). I would have just started in secrecy and then sprung some work...<br />

<br />
Unfortunately our web server died on us and all of the stuff we had up online went down in flames. That means our websites are down, and all of the work files we kept online have disappeared. <br />
<br />
Those of you who visit our website (all both of you) may think that Eon is dead, and coupled with the lack of recent updates, you may have taken down your shrines and stopped wearing your fan-made Eon pyjama hats (y&#039;know, like Link wears?). Have no fear. Eon lives. Of course...<br />

<br />
The overall graphical feel is very good, and I love the style and design of the characters/races. The world displayed in the test level is lush, and will make for some excellent gaming. The feel of walking around as some monstrous Shepherd is truly great, as is hurtling across the map as the swift Shrike. <br />

Huge wet patches started showing up through the carpets last night, and despite our best efforts, its getting worse. After talking to the experts it looks like we&#039;re going to have to tear up all the carpet in here and replace it after the mystery of the flooding itself is solved. <br />
