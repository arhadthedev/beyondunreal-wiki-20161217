      <content:encoded><![CDATA[FYI:<br />
<br />
There is a possible conflict w/code changes in the next patch and current Galtanor&#039;s Invasion code. I am testing the patch and when I join my server with all the other mutators running I can play just fine, however the patched client crashes when I press Esc to bring up the menu to Exit Game. If I run Invasion all by itself (without any other mutators), the client crashes when trying to join the server. Both crashes have the same error message:<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Whenever I try to load up the menu while playing by myself, the game shuts down. Since it shuts down whenever the menu is opened, I can&#039;t join online games, as the menu automatically opens when you first enter. It&#039;s only during Invasion.<br />

When I have them on the commandline, my server in Favorites shows 9999 in the ping and I cannot join via the browser (I can still use &#039;open&#039;). When I remove them the ping shows normal and I can then join.]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[It seems i cant play the new version online! Im always crashing with this little error window which name i cant remember right now. Anyway it always happens randomly after a few minutes. I allready tried it on different servers and also tried it with reinstalling the mod.<br />
<br />
Here is one of the logs, in the log before i had only the same ninja bunny file errors which are very strange because im sure the files are in that package.<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[I have several &#039;bugs&#039; that have been reported, some of them from several versions ago. Also we have recently had UT3 Patch 3 released. Can anyone confirm if they are still having any of these issues?<br />
<br />
* In online games, players will connect, and get to the map view prior to the &quot;Pre-cache&quot; message, and then it disconnects them<br />
* BiaVote hangs when the players lose the game instead of going directly to the map vote<br />
* Game spawns a bot even with &quot;numplay=0&quot; in BiaVote<br />
* Sometimes when all...<br />
