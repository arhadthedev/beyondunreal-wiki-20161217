      <content:encoded><![CDATA[I would really like to start playing CB regularly (VERY regularly) but I can never find a game.  In fact, I&#039;ve only played bots.  3 or 4 servers show up in the ut2004 browser search but they&#039;re always empty.  Anyone know any servers and when games are being played?  I have a machine I could set up as a designated server, but my connection is just regular cable, so I could never handle it.<br />
<br />
Seriously, this mod is so dope, I don&#039;t know why no one is playing (or hopefully I just can&#039;t find them).]]></content:encoded>

<br />
The game is great but I think everyone (players and server hosts) is having a break from the current map after playing it 23 hours straight everyday for about 5 weeks. Currently there seems to be no servers and no players.<br />
<br />
It seems a shame because I miss the speed of gameplay and the comedy antics when I go back to onslaught.<br />

Also wondered if any mappers had considered putting in any non player...<br />

I&#039;ve installed a few things that I downloaded from here and I now have 16 CLN maps in my UT2K4 maps folder. But, I only have about 6 or 7 showing in the ingame maplist. I tried launching some of them manually buy received a missing file error. Here are some of the files that I&#039;m missing:<br />
