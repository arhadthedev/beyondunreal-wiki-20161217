I just finished Pehua and like it a lot. Unfortunately the check point saves don&#039;t seem to be persistent. When I leave the game and come back, I have to replay the complete chapter. Is this because I use the default offline profile, and can it perhaps be solved by creating an online account for The Ball?<br />
Or is UT3 engine uncapable of creating kind of save games?<br />

I suspect this is becoming an issue...<br />

In the second puzzle where you have to pull the ball up the slopes to the timed triggers to open the ball, it&#039;s possible to get the triggers in such a state that it becomes impossible to open the door as the top trigger doesn&#039;t reset.  Unfortunately I&#039;ve not been able to work out what I did to make it happen.  It could be related to disabling the ball collision at exactly the right moment.<br />
