likely your sig was hosted here at the BeyondUnreal forums.<br />
Heh, lt looks like the cleaning lady accidentally deleted the sig folder.<br />
<br />
Worry not, Team Orbit members (past and present) have back-ups on our own domain.<br />
Simply change your sig domain From BeyondUnreal.com to Team Orbit.net<br />

</div>Does this mean IF you have ECE bonus pack you should install that first, THEN the patch. Or does it mean, to have the patch run properely ECE Bonus Pack is a REQUIREMENT to have?<br />

Any ideas how to fix this else?]]></content:encoded>

<br />
My brother-in-law bought a new harddrive, but he has an out-dated MOBO, so it couldnt be used. So i got my old ATA-100 hd out of my pc, stuck his new one in mine. But when i installed my old one the mobo still couldnt detect it. So i got rid of the mobo and put in an old mobo i had lying around *newer then his*. But my brother did it before i could interfere. And he just unplugged everything of the old mobo and now im stuck with figuring out what cable goes where....<br />

Since the holiday season is over, and I am back in town, and my pc is finally working again I can spend a couple hours a night and practice some zbrushing that I know will be used alot this year. I posted a small pimp here at beyondunreals skincity forums here:...<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[After playing an old version of the mod from a demo disc to death (Pc Zone  November 2001) I decided to update. So I did.<br />
<br />
Installing the mod (NeoCairo Beta 5.2) in my Unreal Tournament GOTY folder I found I couldn&#039;t run it as a &#039;Critical Error&#039; keeps on coming up (see attachment).<br />
<br />
Using my limited knowledge I&#039;d say that I&#039;ve installed in the wrong place, or something like that.<br />
<br />
Any help would be much appreciated.<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Congratulations on the awesome content!  I noticed a few mechs among them.  It so happens I&#039;ve built a few mechs myself.  I was wondering... do you have functional mech code, and would you be interested in exchanging some? <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /><br />
<br />
I&#039;ve built three mechs so far: a humanoid and a spider based on ONSHoverCraft, and a big, ponderous humanoid based on ONSTreadCraft.  It&#039;s generic, it&#039;s fully functional, but it&#039;s not perfect yet.  I&#039;d love to have a look at how you guys made it work, swap out some...<br />
