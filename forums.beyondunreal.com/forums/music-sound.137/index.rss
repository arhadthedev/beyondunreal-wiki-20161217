      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Apologies if this is answered already somewhere, but I did a search in this forum for &quot;media ripper&quot; and got zero results.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m a total technical doofus--can&#039;t even get UnrealEd to open on my system, let alone use it for anything. That&#039;s my level of technical expertise. So I&#039;m hoping to extract sound files for my listening pleasure with Unreal Media Ripper, as Unreal Music Ripper hiccups on all sorts of stuff if it&#039;s not from original Unreal. But I can&#039;t find a compiled, ready-to-use version...<br />

<br />
I always wonder how exactly pitch modulation works in Unreal Engine 4. So I take the tuner and thoroughly investigate this question. Here is what I came up with - the comparison table of UE4 pitch modulation.<br />

I had it working at one stage but 1 didn&#039;t seem to mean 1 second, what is it measured in? Everywhere said seconds..I must be doing something wrong?<br />

Ie here I want a wind sound looping, some other wind gust sounds to play now and then with delay, and hawk sound to play now and then (random delays)<br />
