      <content:encoded><![CDATA[I&#039;ve downloaded a few multi CFT maps and the maps work but the four coloured flags don&#039;t show; only the standard blue and red.  I&#039;ve downloaded the MCFT texture file, the Multi CFT Beta2, and MCTF mutators; I&#039;ve enabled it in the mutators menu and selected it in game type.  <br />
<br />
All maps work but no green and yellow flags.  Any suggestions?<br />

Reviewing a map such as that is a waste of my time, and the time of the people who read the review.  Whoever requested the review may be chuckling softly to themselves but I am not amused.

<br />
I was wondering if you have a review queue that mappers can check the progress of their maps on?<br />

I&#039;m interested in finding out roughly when or if my map will be getting a review?<br />

Thanks<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello,<br />
<br />
I&#039;m new to this sort of thing, but I requested a review a while back (April) and it still hasn&#039;t happened. Now I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a massive workload, but there&#039;s other maps that have had reviews far more recently.<br />
<br />
Unless my map is reviewed by my peers, it&#039;s kind of hard for me to get better and produce maps that more people will want to play.<br />
<br />
Is there some weird system other than first come, first served or has my map fallen by the wayside for another reason.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
<br />
P.S....<br />

<br />
I made a request of it 3 months ago (i guess, it&#039;s still on)<br />

First, ONS-Tek got reviwed and then on a hotlist for quile a while, then i released Coldsteel which many people liked. But now i am being currious. ONS-Windfield wasen&#039;t satifiying enough. For some reason i&#039;d like to see coldsteel reviwed. I am very friendly with small and clean review. Just a 20 Minute play test and review of about 2000 letters should be ok. If i am not wrong this post...<br />
