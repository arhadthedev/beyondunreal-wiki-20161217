Since v5 it seems to have disappeared, I used to love filling waves with nothing but Ghosts on a map like FHI-MazeMedium and trying to survive the onslaught of creepy invisible flying assailants.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also &quot;Life After Death&quot; has some issues, occasionally it will spawn a &quot;Boss Zombie&quot; that is completely invincible and cannot die, as the match goes on this one monster will slowly beat down everyone in the map.<br />
<br />
How can I make them stop spawning altogether...<br />
