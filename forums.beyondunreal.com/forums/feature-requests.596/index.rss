      <content:encoded><![CDATA[This is something I thought about possibly trying in a gametype I called surge which was sort of a spinoff of INV:<br />
<br />
Spawn a ball sort of monster, kinda floats around and doesn&#039;t do much... unless you bump it and then boom. Alternatively if you can damage it enough it will go boom on it&#039;s own... making it usefull as a means of damaging or destroying other mobs.<br />
<br />
Variations of the idea were to make it sort of a pandora&#039;s box mob were destroying it via damage would result in it spewing it&#039;s...<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[I think it would be very cool to be able to select from different wave setups in the game. <br />
I know a custom gametype ui is not working but can you make a mutator that makes it possible to select from different wave inis?? Would be cool if you then can simply have various custom wave.inis in your config folder and can choose one in the game and of course would be also nice to see the wave setups in the mutator config options. <br />
And being able to choose a different wave while on a server...<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi,<br />
<br />
First of all, I am running an invasion server and it is a very great game, thanks for making this. <br />
<br />
Except for map group configurations which is already here requested, i have also another request.<br />
Is it possible to make it possible to configure the health of a monster. That will make it possible to configure monsters that needs at least 3 or more hits before it dies, with an insta gib. Espec with bosses will this be more fun imho.<br />
<br />
I have a little mut name monstermadness on my...<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[It is great that you can specify wave configurations for a particular map. A nice extension of that concept would be to allow a configuration to work for multiple maps; such as one for small DM maps or large outdoor maps, etc.<br />
<br />
Perhaps something like:<br />
<br />
[SmallDM InvWaveManager]<br />
; wave configurations...blah, blah<br />
<br />
[LargeOutdoor InvWaveManager]<br />
; wave configurations...blah, blah<br />
<br />
<br />
MapTable1=(&quot;SmallDM&quot;)<br />
MapTable2=(&quot;DM-Deck&quot;,&quot;DM-Shangrila&quot;,...)<br />
<br />
MapTable1=(&quot;LargeOutdoor&quot;)...<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[This small critters are so very powerfull that they are very annoying.<br />
First of all i keep running in them without even noticing it because they are so dark, i think a red glow would fit to also visualize the danger. And then the spider golem keeps throwing a lot of them on the ground so that you have to watch every step and often even after the wave has ended. Maybe makeing the spiders do selfdestroy after 8 sec or something? so it becomes more are weapon then a deadly chaseing mine.<br />

Add remaining-MaxWave-Monsternumber to HUD<br />
<br />
It could look like this: &quot;Monsters: 6/20&quot;.<br />
And after some kills: &quot;Monsters: 6/14&quot;.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px">It occurred to me when I was playing Wave17 at Cys&#039; Wavesetup.<br />
There were only a few monsters (but only Golems) active, and the wave seems to never end</span>.]]></content:encoded>
