<br />
It&#039;s been a long time since I&#039;ve been active on BU, so it&#039;s pleasant for me to be back again<img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /><br />
<br />
Last year, I got myself a gaming headphone - so I wanted to experience the power of my X-Fi in UT using CMSS-3D HP. I first tried out <b>OpenAL</b> (using AL-Audio render device) and then the <b>EAX Patch</b> (using Galaxy Audio render device).<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
In order to do that, I reinstalled UT. I first installed the <b>EAX Patch</b> and the <b>EAX Libraries</b>...<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Yeah, EBM and I were bored in IRC, and he told me about CTF-Titania (which I had never played before) and then he told me about the Team Titans. I couldn&#039;t resist. Then EBM gave me the idea to put in all the legless Krall.... <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie8" alt=":D" title="Big Grin    :D" /><br />
<br />
You&#039;ll just have to see it ingame to believe it! It rocks with Excessive UT. Credits to Patrick Cyr (GorGor) for the awesome titans and &quot;TYGRA&quot; Dmitry Gribanoff for the awesome CTF map. The combination of the two, plus a bit of my own ****age, made the most insane...<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[I downloaded the Father Ted VP and assigned it to a bot, but every time the bot enters my team the game crashes with <a href="http://puu.sh/lLkiM/2e420fa25e.png" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">this message</a>.<br />
<br />
Can anyone make anything out of the error message and is it something I can fix?]]></content:encoded>
