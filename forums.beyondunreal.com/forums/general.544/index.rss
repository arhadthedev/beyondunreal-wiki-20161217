I see a lot of new faces here, new projects, too. So I figured I should reintroduce myself, as I expect everyone (even the SandRock boomerang) has forgotten me by now <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" alt=";)" title="Wink    ;)" /><br />

My goal is to become proficient at everything I do not yet know how to do.  <br />
