Hi,<br />
<br />
I recently installed Win10 upgrade on my computer.  The installation went well, but Unreal 2 doesn&#039;t launch full screen, though it runs nicely otherwise with a narrow band at the top and at the bottom.  The bands are about the size of a normal task bar.  See the picture.<br />
<br />
The Unreal 2.ini and the options in the game are both set to run full screen.  I see no other setting options for this situation.  It ran full screen in my former Windows 8.1 system before...<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been looking at the Unreal2 and XMP (for Windows) uscripts recently, and found that there are a whole lot of differences.  Not too surprising, considering the time between the last U2 patch and the XMP release.*<br />
<br />
But then I wonder if that&#039;s also the case for the Xbox version.  Do the two games run on different engine builds?  Does Unreal2 still use Golem and XMP use Unreal Mesh?<br />
<br />
Does anyone here have an Xbox?  Can we somehow get the resources like the Unreal Scripts and Mesh files...<br />

Those come from the Unreal 2 Disc. Many of them couldn&#039;t be opened and crashed and some crashed with render error which could be fixed by rebuilding lighting, the ones renamed to XBOX in filename are such. Others have been saved on a version incompatible with the current pc one and as such couldn&#039;t be loaded, having errors like bad name index, file EOF errors etc etc. Several maps have missing texture...<br />

I could maybe use terraedit and scale=1152 and x=192 y=192, but I am pretty sure that if terraedit does NOT crash with that type of scaling. Unreal 2 editor WILL crash.<br />

I used to play XMP back in 2004, soooo many memories of fun &amp; killing time <img src="styles/smilies/laugh.gif" class="mceSmilie" alt=":lol:" title="Laugh    :lol:" /><br />
Would love to hear from anyone from those days. I used to be in a guild called DCSB &amp; we used to compete in a tournaments, not sure where anyone is tbh. I also made a simple xmp video back then.....man that was long time ago.<br />
<br />
Any links or just hello from the players from then would be appreciated <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie8" alt=":D" title="Big Grin    :D" /><br />
