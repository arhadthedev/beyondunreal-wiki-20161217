I&#039;d like to try myself in doing a similar thing with the M16A2 model. I want to keep the animations and texture, but improve the original model a bit. Is it a possibility? Can I use a free program like Blender for it?<br />

If possible, how do I start and what do I need to know?]]></content:encoded>
