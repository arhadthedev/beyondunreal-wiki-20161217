<br />
But My first problem I was wondering about is, when I am online and server has that ujt mutator version .29? bt &quot;zeal&quot;<br />
Well this happend a way long time ago too, but you cant move, only shoot on some maps.<br />
I put the map in the editor and played it fine from there, so the only thing I think is that mutator is doing somthing bad.<br />
It also makes my in game &quot;say&quot; have white letters allmost as if I am in spec mode.<br />
Any ideas, ?]]></content:encoded>

<br />
I played a Mod a while ago and loved some the skin textures that where used.<br />
<br />
I am thinking of using them in a SP.<br />
<br />
I read the readme and no offer of using the textures for other mods existed.I emailed the address there to ask if I can use the textures,no reply.<br />
<br />
I understand that many,if not all material made for the UNRed(X) software can be legally(blah) used/stolen for nonprofit maps/sp/etc.. but don&#039;t want to blatantly take/steal others work without sayso...<br />
<br />
