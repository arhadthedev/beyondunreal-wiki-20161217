After a long time I took some time and prepared a new Infiltration CE editione 2012th. I fixed infiltration.ini, AutoPlay Menu (some features did not work due to errors in INF_QMenu.ini), Inf-updater fixed Too.<br />

If it is necessary to add something or fix please let me know. I&#039;d love to upload their setup on the website until the end of the week.<br />

In the next version of Inf, jumping should be removed completely in favor of climbing.

This would work like opening doors and operating switches, where you walk up...<br />

So I was thinking, gee it&#039;d be fun to play DTAS on something like Peru that was small, but I realize that given the nature of DTAS at the moment it&#039;d pretty much suck.<br />
I mean, a good rush could stop the flag before it&#039;s even been placed. And the cap distance would be pretty pathetic for gameplay.<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[I&#039;d assume this&#039;d be easy to program, since it&#039;d be just some number variables to change...<br />
<br />
The idea:<br />
So I was thinking, gee it&#039;d be fun to play DTAS on something like Peru that was small, but I realize that given the nature of DTAS at the moment it&#039;d pretty much suck.<br />
I mean, a good rush could stop the flag before it&#039;s even been placed. And the cap distance would be pretty pathetic for gameplay.<br />
<br />
From this spawned a thought.<br />
What about variable placement times and cap distances?...<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Recoil in INF seems very unrealistic to me. It may be way better than any other game out there, but needs a lot of work. The only weapons I have good experience with are M-16, car-15, M4A1 with trijicon 4x and a haris bipod and M-24. I have some minimal experience with IMI negev (almost the same as the minimi) and the FN mag.<br />
Right now in game it is too difficult to hip shoot with the minimi imo and too easy to shoot rapidly or full-auto with 5.56 when standing, yet a BIT too hard when...<br />
