I pushed back hard on the mouse and managed to land on a small ledge where I proceeded to walk right through the wall. I entered a small brick room where I saw two homosexual Nali-aliens feverishly giving each other reach-arounds and hot-carls until they were blue in the face. They then transformed into tiny silver lobsters and sang Christmas songs. Check it out!]]></content:encoded>
