Thank you for playing Stick Man Doodle!


Installation:
============

1) Select a good place for a game folder.
2) Unzip SMD.ZIP and copy the whole "stickmandoodle" folder to that place.
3) Inside that folder, you can find STICK.EXE and make a Shortcut icon for it, to put on your Desktop.
4) Double-click it and have fun.

To uninstall, simply recycle the "stickmandoodle" folder and any shortcut icons.


Instructions:
============

Objectives:
1) Collect Chests
2) Avoid Fires
3) Reach Doors to Advance

Tips: 
- Press "S" at Doors to advance to the next level.
- You gain more points for each chest you collect.
- Doors give you one extra stick. (1up)


Controls:
========

Tap these controls, rather than hold them.  For example, tapping "A" will start your stickman running to the left.  Tapping "S" will stop him.

W = Jump
S = Stop
A = Run Left
D = Run Right

Q = Quit
Z = Replay

` = FPS display toggle (for use in level 0)

Remember:
At an open Door, press "S" to advance to the next level.


Save Points and SkipIt codes:
============================

Every 5 levels, you will reach a save point.  The game will display a SkipIt code that will allow you to start at that level at any time.  Be sure to write down these codes as you find them.

When you want to use the SkipIt code, start a new game and type "skipit".  A window will open and allow you to enter the 6-letter SkipIt code.  Be careful to enter it exactly.


Troubleshooting:
===============
"I have Vista and ..."
- Sorry, this game will not run with Vista.

"My guy is hard to control."
- Remember to tap the controls, rather than hold them.

"I've found the Door, now what?"
- Remember to press "S" at open Doors to advance to the next level.

"My game starts up in a weird place."
- Hopefully, there is a backup of the "STIKDEF.STM" file found in the Maps folder.  If so, restore it.  If not, email me for a replacement. :)

"The game is running really fast / slow."
- The game will adjust itself to your system clock.  If it's really off at game start, wait at level 0 in-game until it begins to run at the right speed. (12 Frames Per Second, FPS)  Use the FPS display toggle key to see the time synch in action.  Once it says 12 FPS, you're good to go.

"I accidentally overwrote my map file!"
- If you make your own levels, please remember to make frequent backups so you can restore if you need to.


Map Editor Manual:
=================

Warning:
-------
For advanced users only.  STICKED.EXE is the map editor used to create StickManDoodle levels.  There is map space available for over 540 maps, plenty of space to play with.

Get Started:
-----------
1) Make a copy of STIKDEF.stm, the default map file, as a backup.
2) Open STICKED.EXE and hit "S" for save, to save TEST.STM.  This is your work file.

Controls:
--------
Right-Click = Toggle Mouse Cursor
Left-Click = Paint Selected Tile
O-P = Pan Map Left-Right
I-K = Pan Map Up-Down
U-J = Zoom Map In-Out
Z-X = Select Previous/Next Tile
G = Grid Mode Toggle (off / map space / level space / tiles)
S = Save "TEST.STM" Map
D = Load "TEST.STM" Map (do not attempt until "TEST.STM" is available.
Q = Quit

Map Space:
---------
StickManDoodle map files (.STM) contain information on the map space.  Map space is 18 levels wide, 30 levels deep.  Each level is a 10x6 tile space to play in: one level.  The game begins at the top left (map 0) and continues to the left and then on to the next row down after map 17.

Warning: Each Level space must be bounded by earth tiles.  The game will allow the player character to run or fall to adjacent level spaces, but the camera will not follow.

Making your own levels:
----------------------
1) Find an open Level Space.
2) Draw earth tiles to make a place for StickMan to run around in.
3) Place one StickMan tile in the map. (only one)
4) Place some chest tiles in the map. (try to place them under open spaces)
5) Place one Door tile in the map. (only one) (try to place it under an open space)
6) Hit "S" to save the map as "TEST.STM"

Playtest your own levels:
------------------------
1) Rename "TEST.STM" to "STIKDEF.STM"
2) Launch STICK.EXE
3) Type "icheat"
4) Press "N" to go to the next map or "P" to go to the previous map
5) Find your map and type "icheat" again to play as normal.

Remember to make a backup of STIKDEF.STM before attempting to make your own levels.


THANKS AGAIN FOR PLAYING STICK MAN DOODLE!
