Foreign and English Addon Community Voice pack for Infiltration 2.9


- Installation and setup

Copy both ComVoices2.int and ComVoices2.u to your unrealtournament/system directory.
Then, go to the "character/team" screen in infiltration's "The team" menu, and select the 
voice you would like to use.

NOTE : even if you do these steps properly, you still won't be able to use the new voices
online unless the server you're on has them enabled as a ServerPackage. 
If it hasn't, your characters voice commands will default to an original INF voice.
