			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>So, tried UE 4.14.1 + FMOD 1.08.15 + Oculus Audio SDK 1.1.1 which gives no spatialization at all. Oculus Audio SDK 1.0.4 and older UE4 / FMOD work fine, current Oculus Audio SDK + UE 4.14.1 + current FMOD = no luck.<br />
<br />
This is extremely tiring. Instead of working on the project all I am doing it setting up, cross checking if stuff works and reporting bugs that never get fixed. I am just wasting my life with this :(<br />
<br />
It would be much nicer if UE4 finally got its new audio system finalized, where Gear VR would get HRTF spatialized sound (with Oculus Audio SDK built-in, so that sh#t would just work out of the box).<br />
<br />
Are there any good news on the horizon ?<br />
<br />
Thanks beforehand</div>

I'm at a bit of a loss, here. Ever since 4.13 (currently 4.14.1), I have not been able to build this map. I don't know if it's a setting in lightmass that I screwed with, or what, but building all works just fine up until the Lighting Build, which stays at 0% for anywhere from 5-15 mins, then Lightmass hangs, displaying this message. Sometimes I get a full UE4 CTD, other times, Lightmass crashes, the build is cancelled, and I go back to the Editor.<br />
<br />
Any information is hugely appreciated.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>/* This is for the game Rocket League*/<br />
<br />
<br />
Hello, so I am trying to predict collisions inside of a UWorld. Right now I can predict the ball's flight path by using an equation I made by getting 3 sets of x,y,z coordinates. This only works until the ball interacts with an object inside the world although. My problem is now, getting the coordinates of all the world materials that can cause collisions and check the ball position against those? I am kinda foggy on this part, and if anyone has some suggestions on alternate or better ways of doing this, let me know.</div>

<br />
Im looking to create a server where the only method for the player to gain xp is to kill dinos. I figured the easiest way to accomplish this is to just remove the xp gain for harvesting and crafting. Im currently searching the forums for anything that even slightly resembles this as a current mod but have come up with nothing. Looking for any and all info on how to get this ball rolling. I would like to restrict this mod to players only, if it were to be dinos as well it might be very difficult to level up your harvesting mounts.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to hearing what you all think.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>The way my game right now for selecting the current player skill, is to hit a toggle button, which pauses the game, shows the cursor and brings up the menu to show selectable skills.  I want it to be quick to select a new skill, so I dont want to have buttons and such, and I assumed that this method would be easier than setting up 10 Input action events, or hard coding the actionbar for 0-9.  I'm also liking not having a visible actionbar cluttering up the screen..<br />
<br />
  I'm currently using Get Mouse Position Scaled by DPI, saving the current X position to a variable, then comparing the mouse position to that initial position to determine which skill gets selected.    But, if my player turns right a bit, and I toggle the menu, My mouse position is now way off to the right, so I cant go outside of the viewport, (and if I do, next click loses focus of the game).  Which doesnt allow me to select skills to the right of center. <br />
<br />
I cant find a way to get the cursor to wrap, <a href="https://answers.unrealengine.com/questions/6473/request-mouse-cursor-screen-wrap.html" target="_blank">although I did find a feature request that got put in back in 2014</a>.  I tried using the Mouse X Axis, but it seems that gets disabled when the game is paused, or when the input mode changes?  And I cant find a way to set the mouse position back to 0 when I activate the menu.   This is all blueprints by the way, so no c++.    Any ideas?</div>
