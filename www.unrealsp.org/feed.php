In general, Unreal's weapons are situational. The reason why weapons like the Flak Cannon tend to just out perform later acquired ones has less to do with their power but the state of Unreal's level design and progression of enemies. You're often in positions where circle-strafing or attacking in open rooms with space is the norm, and the Flak, Eightball, and ASMD are proficient over other choices. Though, the Flak tends to be useful in almost any situation.<br /><br />Anyway, things I dislike that nobody seems to care about. The dodge mechanic. I don't think I ever used it until UT. It seems few level designers take the mechanic into account outside of UT also, even after all these years.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.unrealsp.org/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=19">Mister_Prophet</a> — Yesterday, 17:21</p><hr />

Those three weapons aren't on par with the Razorjack in terms of hitting things behind walls (you can't kill shit with the ASMD behind walls without combos, and I don't mean just hiding behind a pillar). With the RazorJack you have full control of this feature and the ammo for it are super plentiful - also the fact enemies can't dodge it at all. It's overall better than the Rifle.<br /><br />I hate the Eightball actually. The only time it feels strong is when you hit 4+ grenades at once, while the rockets have zero feedback power (the only time they feel good is when you hit a large 2000+ mass target with 6 rockets, tl;dr you use the 8Ball for grenades only).<br /><br /><br />One thing I really dislike is how the enemies move SO FAST while being hit by high dps weapon like the Stinger/Minigun/PulseGun/Impaler. You're basically helping the enemy kill you.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.unrealsp.org/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4">UBerserker</a> — Yesterday, 09:11</p><hr />

My biggest complaint about Unreal (and many fps games for that matter) is the overabundance of ammo.  I understand the developers wanted to ensure that even the most inaccurate players had plenty of ammo, but I absolutely hate being maxed out with every weapon.  I enjoy conserving my ammo and being forced to use every weapon in the inventory.  With maxed out ammo, I sometimes stop caring about any possible challenge and rush through things wielding only the Flak Cannon, ASMD, or Eightball Gun.  This is the primary reason I worked on the Limbo Difficulty mutator.  I felt the monsters needed more health so ammo has to be conserved.  This also partially solves the problem that integration mentioned above, since you are forced to use all weapons in order to conserve ammo - even though you get some less useful weapons later (although I do think the RazorJack is useful).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.unrealsp.org/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=16">Lightning Hunter</a> — Yesterday, 08:45</p><hr />

That's indeed something I perceive but ignore.<br /><br />Here's the next thing: <strong>lighting</strong>. There are people who say lighting in Unreal is great. Simply no. The contrast is too big. In reality, walls reflect light spreading it into the whole room and a little around corners. In Unreal, there are too many black or too dark places unless mappers put lights everywhere. This makes me increasing the brightness/gamma setting. Not that long ago, I played the alpha version of Resurgence and I thought: Hey the lighting looks great. And in this moment I realized I hadn't tweaked the brightness setting yet. Afterwards it didn't look as good anymore but hey finally I could see. Also noteworthy: because there are too many dark places some mappers use zone light. With increased brightness it's sometimes like you can see the whole map and don't need flashlight and flares at all. PPS: I dislike playing dark games on mirroring screens and in too bright environments.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>UBerserker wrote:</cite><br />Razorjack lets you kill things behind walls.

For a usual playstyle (first play), the Razorjack is really not theat great. With Flak or ASMD I can kill every enemy (except Snipers) only suffering minor damage. Can't say the same about Razor and GesBio. Also, I was speaking about Unreal weapons not Unreal Tournament weapons. 90+% of maps and packs out there were made for Unreal.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.unrealsp.org/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=385">integration</a> — Yesterday, 06:23</p><hr />

Of course only Unreal related things.<br /><br />One thing I dislike is the order in which you get the weapons in Unreal. You get the GesBioRifle and Razorjack<strong> after</strong> the ASMD, Eightball and Flakcannon, which makes them pretty obsolete. Okay, Razorjack can be used to kill Behemoth and GesBioRifle is good in combination with a Toxin Suit but they are nothing compared to ASMD, Eightball and Flakcannon. ASMD is good against enemies at every distance (but a little low on ammo), Eightball has a huge damage potential and a  huge area of effect. Flak Cannon is the best weapon at close range and also decent in midrange.<br /><br />And here comes the thing: I played every map and pack out there and I can't remember any mapper giving you the GesBioRifle and Razorjack <strong>before</strong> the ASMD, Eightball and Flakcannon. Sometimes it even goes so far that you'll barely find any ammo for GesBioRifle and Razorjack. For example in RTNP there're just 2 locations where you can pick up razor blades.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.unrealsp.org/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=385">integration</a> — 13 Dec 2016, 08:54</p><hr />

<blockquote><div><cite>Semfry wrote:</cite><br />This is the most ONP-ass level in ONP. It looks good and has some impressive moments (although lots of it is ripped from DavidM's DM-Seed, which stuck out right away. Then again, I'm not sure on the timeline so it could have been partially concurrent?), but it's very linear, and most of the set-piece moments are more style than substance. Also, despite looking good, there's not really much of a sense of place beyond some generic Skaarj base; partially because of the linearity, but also because it adheres so dogmatically to ONP's cookie-cutter &quot;leet&quot; design style that it doesn't feel like it has anything distinguishing about it aesthetically. It does nothing notably bad and doesn't have any particular technical design flaws, but, in the end, it's just sort of there.<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />Interesting comment. BTW I just checked the forum and saw that last time this was on MOTW, DavidM actually showed up!<br /><br />IMO, this is still - by the standards of <em>Unreal</em> - a great map, and it actually felt like it was slowly raising the level of the campaign back towards its earlier heights after two maps that - while fine in themselves (if really short and most definitely &quot;just there&quot;) - were quite a significant step down after the insane three-map suite that is <em>NP19</em> - in fact others have said that it would have made more sense to move directly from <em>Wipeout</em> to <em>The Lands of Rostivelt</em> (while keeping the awesome starting cave from <em>Entry to the Fire God Temple</em>, I'll add).<br /><br />I remember thinking the starting canyon had a cool design, yes (watching the video here, I admit I did not remember the Skaarj fighter and the Skaarj shuttle - the latter is unique to <em>ONP</em> - which make a brief appearance at the beginning of the map... it's cool to see that kind of thing but the campaign has shitloads of moments like that), and the Giant Manta fight was memorable despite being easy. BTW, the music section that plays when the Giant Manta attacks is awesome. I also recall being ambushed by a Skaarj that I mistakenly thought was dead <img class="smilies" src="http://www.unrealsp.org/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> that's despite the trick being used more than once in this level. Good fights overall. <br /><br />Now a confession: of course, looking at the playthrough here it always seems everything is so easy, but man, on my first playthrough of this map I actually thought it was <em>hard</em>... essentially because of the last segment (although I have to say I did die once due to the Skaarj that jump down on you as you move out of the base): you see, back then I didn't realise I could destroy the turret <img class="smilies" src="http://www.unrealsp.org/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> I definitely tried, but it didn't blow up with just a few shots so I assumed I had to make it across the lava zone under fire of the turret - making the passage very challenging with several reloads and that Skaarj showing up on the other side just added to my pain and eventually, I made it with literally a couple of hit points <img class="smilies" src="http://www.unrealsp.org/images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" /> and I was so nervous that after a quick save on the other side I also had to reload a couple of times due to the Skaarj with rocket launchers in the last big hall. <br />That sure was memorable, and IMO that makes <em>The Lands of Rostivelt</em> one of the hardest maps in <em>ONP</em>!<br /><br />There's also one stupid secret area... however the video just showed me there's another pretty legit secret area! <img class="smilies" src="http://www.unrealsp.org/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Doublez-Down wrote:</cite><br />Really enjoyed the scale and lighting in this map, and I remember it being fairly awe-inspiring at the time.

I will go ahead and move all playerstarts to the beginning of the map in that case.  When are you going to play RTNPUEv11?<br /><br />Edit:  Ok, I updated Eldora so all the playerstarts are in the first area with the pool of water (where the bars would initially trap you).  I uploaded the updated map by itself.

Played it on a fresh installment of Unreal Gold with 227 patch. No missing packages or whatever. I really liked to play as a Skaarj. That feels different. Sadly, there are barely any mirroring surfaces where you can have a look at yourself. Now I feel like to play as a Brute, shooting rockets out of the left hand with primary fire and out of the right hand with secondary fire <img class="smilies" src="http://www.unrealsp.org/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> I also liked that Resurgence uses new (+ Alpha) weapons and pawns (iirc those Impaler wielding enemies are from Unreal 2). Overall, great build quality. I also liked how the enemies were placed, for example the first encounters with spiders and enemy Skaarj.<br /><br />I think there should have been a note in the first map telling you that you can lunge by pressing primary and secondary fire simultaneously. I would have missed the Nali village underground (that key is hard to see) and Flak Cannon if I hadn't looked in the editor. Also you will probably get low on health in ResurgenceTwo if you miss the secret in the Nali village. I had to look in the editor two further times to know how to proceed, both times involving ventilation shafts. One of those times I tried to destroy destroyable ventilation shaft bars but it didn't work on my first tries. Also in the last map there was some Skaarj intermediate boss who looked too much like a regular Skaarj. And one time I found ASMD ammo (also not sure if there's a minigun somewhere).<br /><br />Weapons:<br />Raziks: Well designed but takes too much time to charge completely. I would have increased the ammo regeneration speed and reduced the max ammo a little in return.<br />Stunner: I didn't really use it. Barely any chances to throw enemies in abysses and lava pits and if you don't do that Stunner stays pretty useless.<br />Impaler: The first person mesh looked great but the alternate fire projectile could have been more visible. I think alternate fire rate is too high. For example against a Skaarj you can do: shoot at Skaarj -&gt; Skaarj evades -&gt; shoot again to the spot where the Skaarj is dodging to -&gt; hit Skaarj -&gt; repeat<br />Razorjack: I liked that the blades kept getting stuck in level geometry.<br /><br />bugs:<br />- ResurgenceOne crashed when I tried to save.<br />- The aforementioned crash in the Nali village of ResurgenceTwo: I closed Unreal to look in the editor. When I loaded a savegame, the game always crashed when I looked in the direction of the spring / beam of light.<br />- There's a BSP problem in ResurgenceThree. You are standing on some kind of bridge and a Skaarj in a control room destroys a window to charge at you. Basically, it's like there's invisible level geometry that blocks you and your projectiles.<br />- One time ResurgenceFour crashed on loading.<br />- (Kinda offtopic but since it's a 227 exclusive map pack I want to mention the following 227 bug: Pawns with bLeadTarget set to true are supposed to shoot where the player is heading, 227 messed up a collision check, so when the calculated heading spot is in level geometry, they will shoot in direction of that wall, and otherwise they will shoot in the direction where you are standing. Basically, that means the pawns will barely hit you if you keep moving. About 3 years ago, I reported that bug shortly after a new version was released. 227 staff said to include it in the next 227 version but there hasn't been a new version yet.)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.unrealsp.org/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=385">integration</a> — 11 Dec 2016, 21:16</p><hr />

Playerstarts are one of those things you can do very little to via mut. I can filter them out and place new ones but if used in conjunction with the spawn at player mut it becomes unreliable because of its fail-safe system that re-enables original playerstarts. It's only guaranteed to work correctly for the initial load spawn since a player death may occur somewhere they're unable to spawn at, triggering the fail-safe. I haven't actually tested without this mut but that case should never experience the same problems since nothing else modifies playerstarts during gameplay. And there's also the problem you mentioned of starting from that map.<br /><br />Moving all playerstarts to the beginning would be for the best. Even if I didn't change anything in the existing RTNPUE mut it wouldn't cause any actual problems.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.unrealsp.org/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">zYnthetic</a> — 11 Dec 2016, 19:16</p><hr />

I'll add the flame damage as an option eventually I think. Probably make it with the switches:<br />CanCauseBurnDamageToPawns= True/False<br />CanLightPawnsOnFire= True/False<br />bCanSpreadToOtherDecos= True/False<br /><br />Filtering it to spread to other wooden decorations can be tricky but I can make it work. I guess if you want realism then spraying rockets into a warehouse full of crates ought to result in a raging inferno if that's your thing. I can tell you from playtesting that it will cause you to rethink how you just willy-nilly blast away at things especially if you are in a forest. More than once I've set a couple of trees on fire only to have it trap me eventually as it spread across the hillside and I wasn't paying close enough attention.<br /><br />Been adding more decos to this. The table, chairs, lamps, lanterns, and barrels are all properly destroyable now. Short vid:<br /><a href="https://youtu.be/w9oyS-D4XZU" class="bbvideo" data-bbvideo="560,315" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/w9oyS-D4XZU</a><br /><br />Sorry for the added music. Afterburner picked up the stream I was listening to. Anyway when destroying the hanging lanterns I added a check to suppress any light actors found in a small radius (40 uu) to remove any extra lights added by mappers. You can see the lightmap remains though, not much I can do about that. Still it's a visual improvement.<br /><br />After the holidays I'll add this to my server and send it out if anyone wants to play around with it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.unrealsp.org/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=158">gopostal</a> — 11 Dec 2016, 12:25</p><hr />

Guys, I have v1.1 of RTNPUE pretty much ready.  I was just now packaging it.  Do you want to test it?  I could have it uploaded and ready to test in coop tonight.  I can give a link in this thread for coop testing purposes.  If the test is successful, I will release it officially (on the Moddb page and official thread and all).<br /><br />I do have one tiny bug I was working on, but I need to know if it will mess with coop (or anything else for that matter).  I noticed that in Eldora, all the playerstarts are halfway through the map.  This is not a problem when players begin the map using the teleporter, but I noticed that if people select Eldora from the map selection window (using the RTNPUE menu), they start at the halfway point.  I'm not sure how this ever got passed beta testing in v1.  If I add a playerstart where the teleporter is, will this mess with coop?<br /><br />Edit:  I made the decision to upload RTNPUEv1.1 for coop testing purposes.  PLEASE, whoever downloads this, do NOT share it. Although this very well may be the final version, it's possible there will be updates - especially if any bugs are found in coop that need to be remedied.

Done. Some bugs.<br />I missed one teleporter that's changing the gametype moving to nalic2. Other than that, the extension for RTNPUE is pretty solid.<br />I'm going to need to take a closer look at CoopSuite spawn-at-players since I suspect I compiled an older source. AFK timer was working during dev but not in the version I put on the server. I also included more spawning conditions and failsafes, which don't seem to be working either.<br />I know I said 7b next week, but I'd like to give RTNPUE one final run (with SaP fixed). Mostly to wrap it up and second, 7B  still needs a lot of attention that I can't afford to give right now. Next week is also going to be it for this month. The following weekend I'll be gone for Xmas and then NYE is after that. I might be able to put in a few days on 7b over that time and see what I can do about running it the first weekend of January.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.unrealsp.org/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">zYnthetic</a> — 10 Dec 2016, 23:35</p><hr />
