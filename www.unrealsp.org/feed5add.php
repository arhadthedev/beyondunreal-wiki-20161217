<blockquote><div><cite>MrLoathsome wrote:</cite><br />Well hell.<br />Did a test earlier this afternoon, and it downloaded the &quot;dummy&quot; RMusicplayer that Core<br />had made fine.   Was playing thru Voidness tonight with one of the few regulars, and some<br />player I had never seen before joined, so i think things are downloading, at least most of the time.<br /><br />My redirect is located elsewhere, and has been doing odd things recently.... Not sure what they<br />have going on.<br /><br />Was there any sort of message?  Refused to send?<br /><br />Sorry I been so slow to report back.  RL has been nuts the last month, so I haven't been playing<br />much at all.<br /><br />Did have an issue tonight on Voidness at the final battle with the 2 Taryooogahahha (sp) bosses.<br />They would NOT die.   Will have to retest that with a totally &quot;clean&quot; setup and see if it happens<br />again before you waste any time looking into it.<br /><br />Continued play and am 1/2 way thru NeonNights now.<br /><br />More feedback soon I hope....<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br /><br />Not really, just either &quot;version mismatch&quot; or if I did remove the .u file &quot;you miss a package&quot; - perhaps I should've remove all RMusic related System files though.<br /><br />The Tsathogguas at the end of Map 2 (the area you teleport in) are NOT KILLABLE. You have to run to the exit with the help of the translocator.<br /><br />Thanks though. I think the coop bugs I'm expecting might solely concern Map12/13/14.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.unrealsp.org/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4">UBerserker</a> — 12 Dec 2016, 23:57 — Replies 141 — Views 9184</p><hr />
