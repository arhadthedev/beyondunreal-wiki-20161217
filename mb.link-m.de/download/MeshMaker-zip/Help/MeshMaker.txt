Umod Installation
===============================================================================

Double-click the umod file and follow the instructions on the screen.


===============================================================================
Zip Installation
===============================================================================

The zip file includes information about in which subdirectories the files
should be placed; simply extract all files in your UnrealTournament folder, and
all files should go where they belong to.

If that doesn't work out, extract the files manually into the following
directories:

  UnrealTournament\Help             MeshMaker.txt
  UnrealTournament\Help\MeshMaker   *.html, *.gif, *.jpg
  UnrealTournament\Maps             MyLamp.t3d
  UnrealTournament\System           MeshMaker.exe


===============================================================================
Info
===============================================================================

MeshMaker is a Windows-based Unreal and Unreal Tournament editing tool that 
makes converting UnrealEd brushes (or, more precisely, prefabs) to Decoration
actors a matter of seconds.

See the included documentation for details.
