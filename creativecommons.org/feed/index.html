<p>What does it mean to listen to the past through a truly modern lens? This is the question the Dutch project <a href="http://revivethis.org/">re:vive</a> seeks to answer. Working with renowned electronic and experimental musicians such as <a href="https://soundcloud.com/lakker">Lakker,</a> <a href="http://www.rolyporter.com/">Roly Porter,</a> and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/bas-mooy">Bas Mooy,</a> the project from the <a href="http://www.beeldengeluid.nl/en/netherlands-institute-sound-and-vision">Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision</a> draws on global archives and museums to encourage legal, creative reuse of historic sounds.</p>
<p>In the words of Gregory Markus, coordinator at the institute, “Electronic musicians are probably the largest remix community in the world&#8230;DJs and electronic musicians usually are sound geeks who just love sound and they love learning and experimenting, and they’re the perfect match for audio archives.”</p>
<p>The perfect match between musicians and archives has turned into a prolific and fruitful project. This week, the project released <a href="https://fogmountainrecords.bandcamp.com/album/010">another compilation</a> with a companion photo book, all in the public domain, which is available for download via <a href="http://www.fogmountainrecords.com/">Fog Mountain Records.</a></p>
<p><strong>What prompted this project? How have you defined the scope of what kinds of sounds and artists you want to work with?<br />
</strong>This project was inspired by seeing<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAgBvyDqOBE"> Matthew Herbert do a Boiler Room session from the British Library</a>. It made me think, if Boiler Room and Matthew Herbert, two of the coolest and most renowned names in electronic music, were excited to visit and celebrate an archive&#8217;s collection, who else would be interested? But I knew I wanted to run this project right. I wanted it to not just be a heritage institution trying to engage &#8220;creative&#8221; communities from the outside, I wanted it to be intertwined and accepted by the community. In my opinion, the only way to effectively and actively engage a community is to be a part of it. After bouncing ideas around between people involved in electronic music in Europe and the US, we developed a concept and framework and reached out to our first artists, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/lakker">Lakker.</a> It has been incredible to see the response and excitement from so many different artists and fans. We keep learning and growing. Everyone is so encouraging and eager to contribute and help out that we actually can&#8217;t keep up!</p>
<p>When it comes to sounds we have two main criteria (in addition to being openly licensed!): The sounds must have context or a story. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s most exciting for me when it comes to archives: the stories and connections we find related to certain materials and the relationships the artists develop with this context. Some items have absolutely no metadata so we have to do some research but that’s also part of the fun. The sounds need to have enough sonic character so that they&#8217;re interesting to work with. Lots of openly licensed archival material like wax cylinders or old 78s have so much noise that they&#8217;re pretty useless for non-research purposes. Field recordings are most interesting sonically but not every archive has those or if they do they&#8217;re modern and still under a copyright.</p>
<p>When it comes to artists we have found ourselves in a niche of experimental electronic and techno but we&#8217;re open to everything!</p>
<p><strong>How do you find the public domain sounds, in particular for the Sample Packs? What kinds of sounds are your favorites?<br />
</strong>We tend to favor our own collections that we hold at the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision because we have such extensive, openly licensed materials and the institute wants to keep that growing. But for other things, Europeana is a great tool if you know how to navigate it and then visiting various archive&#8217;s specific portals to see if they have content available online, openly licensed and for download. Few things are worse than finding material online for streaming, openly licensed that you can&#8217;t download. As noted above, field recordings are most interesting to work with from a sampling point of view because they&#8217;re so complex. But finding obscure 78s on the National Library of France&#8217;s portal, Gallica is always exciting!</p>

<p><strong>How do you choose the artists you want to work with? What is your method of working with artists to create projects?</strong><br />
We have a mix of people in the scene when it comes to artists. Working with these materials in a musical and conceptual manner is not for everyone- and it doesn&#8217;t have to be! We want to work with artists who will take this material, spend time with it and examine it in order to create a new work and own that work.</p>
<p>We come up with a curatorial theme and then work from there, reaching out to artists directly and personally. This project is close to our hearts – it&#8217;s not just a job anymore. I hope this puts us on the same level as the artists we work with whose music isn&#8217;t just their job, it&#8217;s their lives.</p>
<p>For some projects like the compilations we’ve done the process is based more on providing the sounds, footage, and images to allow artists to use their own experiences and knowledge to fill in the blanks and go crazy. But with the bigger sessions we’ve done we invite the artists to the Netherlands where they meet with researchers and academics to really get some context.</p>
<blockquote><p>RE:VIVE tries to straddle the worlds of PR/marketing stunt, community outreach and academia. It’s been refreshing to also see how excited and curious academics are about the project and how willing they are to share their knowledge.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>How does licensing play into this project? You&#8217;re working with Public Domain sounds and licensing them under CC. How do you explain that to artists, collaborators, and the public?<br />
</strong>We don’t only work with PD material simply because there isn’t enough audio material. We use a lot of Creative Commons material so long as it’s not “non-derivative”. But the most interesting thing we’ve learned from this project is just how unaware many artists and labels are of Creative Commons. I remember having a meeting with the editor-in-chief of a large music editorial platform and he joked “is that still a thing? I remember it was big in 2008…”. Our first release was planned to be released under Creative Commons BY SA NC but at the last minute the label changed that. They said they’d love to investigate Creative Commons more but they’re already so busy trying to stay afloat that it’s not on the agenda so for the time being they’re sticking to All Rights Reserved.</p>
<p>When we ask artists or tell artists that their new works have to be released under Creative Commons they’re pretty open to it since it’s a special project but I don’t foresee anyone we’re working with adopting it as their norm. Artists are easier to convince than labels but labels need to see financial impact use cases etc.</p>
<p>The other big thing we’ve been confronted with about licensing and Creative Commons is that people just don’t understand it. All Rights Reserved is crystal clear. It’s going to be tough for RE:VIVE to change mindsets but we can at least talk to artists one at a time and let them know what’s up and what Creative Commons stands for, what it means for them and their work and why they should consider adopting it.</p>
<blockquote><p>Electronic musicians are probably the largest remix community in the world. They share music at an alarmingly fast rate with mixes and DJ-sets online all of which feature uncleared, copyrighted material, but most don’t care. They sample from everywhere and anywhere, they don’t clear these samples, they just hope that they don’t get caught. Most make so little money and have warped the samples to the point where they’re unrecognizable so they think they’ll never get caught. RE:VIVE can’t work in this manner because we are part of a public institution. We play by the rules and we want to play by the rules so that we can see what’s working and what’s not and initiate change at a policy level.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are a few collections we want to work with that are based in the US that are available for personal, non-commercial reuse, but it’s hard to approach music labels and say, “We want to use this collection, tell its story, and give it some attention because it’s incredible material&#8230; and there’s no commercial reuse so there’s no financial value in it for you.” If they could sell the music or press it to vinyl or stream it more doors would open and these collections hidden in corners of the web could get the love and attention we feel they deserve. But rights clearing takes time and money which artists, labels, and archives really don’t have.</p>
<p><strong>Do you see this initiative as translatable to other languages, record labels, and types of music? What other projects influence you? Where do you look for inspiration?<br />
</strong>I certainly hope it’s translatable. We’d love to see more archives get directly involved because we already have artists and labels lining up out the door. RE:VIVE is an initiative from an archive first and foremost and our job is to promote archives and reuse. We don’t want to just take content from the web and reuse it, we want the archives to get involved in the process, meet the artists, and impart their knowledge and love for their collections on them. If they can see the excitement we’ve encountered when bringing people to our depots, watching them explore the thousands of old record players, sifting through thousands of records. You really see the connection. DJs and electronic musicians usually are sound geeks who just love sound and they love learning and experimenting, and they’re the perfect match for audio archives.</p>
<p>Other labels and genres of music are definitely an option too! That’s the beauty of starting with audio and music. It’s so much easier to build on top of it with texts, images and footage.</p>
<blockquote><p>I like to refer to archives as one-stop shopping – they have sounds to sample, images for artwork, footage for music videos and context for inspiration. It’s fantastic and transferable to so many genres. We focus on sample based music so we can have the most direct reuse.</p></blockquote>
<p>In terms of other projects that inspire us? I am always inspired by our resident tour guide at <a href="http://www.beeldengeluid.nl/en/netherlands-institute-sound-and-vision">Sounds and Vision</a>, Rob de Bie. His love for sound and history of recorded sound and moving image is contagious, the British Library’s Cheryl Tipp and Will Prentice from the sound archive are also wonderful. The National Library of France’s Gallica portal, the Rijksmueum and National Archive of the Netherlands open collections remind me of all the possibilities. And then of course all the artists and labels we work with. But I think I get the most inspiration from my old friends in Iowa City who run a music festival and label called <a href="http://missioncreekfestival.com/">Mission Creek Music Festival.</a> Their love and support was so unyielding. They just saw that something was missing in the town and wanted to fill that gap but they did not want to do it in an isolationist way. They brought in everyone in the community and made everyone feel involved and supported. I cherish that and I think that emotional connection might be missing too often in projects. We try to channel that somehow!</p>
<p><strong>After this release, what&#8217;s next for your project? What do you hope to make and discover next?<br />
</strong>We have quite a few releases planned for the first half of 2017 already that we’re really excited about. What Sound and Vision, the institute that started the RE:VIVE project, hopes for is to set a leading example for other institutes much like the Rijksmuseum did with their public domain dump in 2013, which changed the game.</p>
<p>It’d be great to see more institutes open up or at least add clarity to their rights statements. Even just in the Netherlands we have so many stories we want to share I think we’ll be pretty busy for a while. We’re on the hunt for funding for these!</p>
<p>In a perfect world we’d love to get the point where doing a RE:VIVE session is the same as doing a Boiler Room session, a kind of right of passage for electronic musicians, but we have a lot of work to do to get there!</p>
<p>In the end though, if we can just get a few more people interested in their local archive and see the archives equally get engaged with their local arts scene then our job is done.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m thrilled to announce two new additions to Creative Commons’ full-time staff—Claudio Ruiz and Simeon Oriko. Both Claudio and Simeon will be taking on newly developed positions focused on supporting the growth of CC’s global network.</p>
<p>Expanding and strengthening the Creative Commons global network has been a primary focus of the organization since our most recent Summit in Seoul, South Korea. Most recently, we announced <a href="https://creativecommons.org/2016/09/08/announcing-2017-creative-commons-global-summit/">CC&#8217;s next global summit,</a> which will take place in Toronto at the end of April, and will bring together hundreds of community members from around the world to work on growing the commons. Leading up to the Summit, the CC community will be drafting its first collaborative global movement strategy. This effort follows an extensive <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Global_Network_Strategy#Research">research project</a> aimed at identifying the specific needs of community members. It will mean a big shift in how CC builds, enables, and works as a network and a global movement. And it will require strong leadership and support, which is why I am so pleased to bring on Claudio and Simeon into these new roles.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-51837 aligncenter" src="https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/claudio_photo-1024x682.jpg" alt="claudio_photo" width="553" height="368" srcset="https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/claudio_photo-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/claudio_photo-300x200.jpg 300w, https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/claudio_photo-768x512.jpg 768w, https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/claudio_photo-60x40.jpg 60w, https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/claudio_photo-50x33.jpg 50w, https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/claudio_photo-233x155.jpg 233w, https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/claudio_photo-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/claudio_photo.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 553px) 85vw, 553px" /></p>
<p>In Claudio’s position as Director of Ecosystem Strategy, he will focus on supporting the development and implementation of the new global network strategy. He will collaborate with the CC global community to develop plans and recommendations for shifting Creative Commons to a more open, global, and inclusive organization, and a more powerful, impactful movement led by its community. Claudio is based in Chile and speaks Spanish and English. Read <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aR4FpI61xQdz-iR12zQWK2rY12CUyIF_I4AlyIMRpkc/edit">Claudio’s full job description</a></p>
<p>As Network Manager, Simeon will provide daily support to affiliate teams, <img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-51838" src="https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Simeon-Oriko_avatar_1480630738-300x300-1.jpeg" alt="simeon-oriko_avatar" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Simeon-Oriko_avatar_1480630738-300x300-1.jpeg 300w, https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Simeon-Oriko_avatar_1480630738-300x300-1-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Simeon-Oriko_avatar_1480630738-300x300-1-40x40.jpeg 40w, https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Simeon-Oriko_avatar_1480630738-300x300-1-50x50.jpeg 50w, https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Simeon-Oriko_avatar_1480630738-300x300-1-155x155.jpeg 155w, https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Simeon-Oriko_avatar_1480630738-300x300-1-32x32.jpeg 32w, https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Simeon-Oriko_avatar_1480630738-300x300-1-64x64.jpeg 64w, https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Simeon-Oriko_avatar_1480630738-300x300-1-96x96.jpeg 96w, https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Simeon-Oriko_avatar_1480630738-300x300-1-128x128.jpeg 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 85vw, 300px" />collect information about their work, make connections and introductions, and manage administrative needs. This is an essential role to facilitate everyday collaboration and connectivity in the network. Simeon is based in Kenya and speaks Swahili and English.

<p>Claudio and Simeon have been part of the CC community for many years and their work has been integral to the growth of our global network. For the Creative Commons movement to continue to grow and to flourish, ongoing and open communication between CC HQ and all the members of our community is a must. I couldn’t be happier to be able to make an investment in leadership that will support this communication and facilitate a new era of global engagement.</p>
<p>Please join me in welcoming Claudio and Simeon. If you have any questions about their work or about how to get involved in CC’s network, please send a message to <a href="mailto:network@creativecommons.org">network@creativecommons.org.</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About a month ago, CC moved its daily communications to Slack, the team messaging service popular with communities around the world. You can read more about our decision here.</p>
<p>What a month it’s been. We’ve seen our daily community grow to nearly 500 users, with an average of 110 people posting every day. We’ve also seen significant growth in the geographic range of our community, with dedicated channels for different regions like <a href="https://creativecommons.slack.com/messages/cc-europe/">#cc-europe</a> (55 members), <a href="https://creativecommons.slack.com/messages/cc-mena">#cc-mena</a> (20 members), <a href="https://creativecommons.slack.com/messages/cc-africa">#cc-africa</a> (22 members) <a href="https://creativecommons.slack.com/messages/cc-latinamerica">#cc-latinamerica</a> (19 members), and others. In many of these channels, communities are using their local languages to communicate and collaborate.</p>
<p>In addition, our IRC bridge has allowed users who prefer those tools to connect with each other without leaving their preferred tool, seeing the messages in our #general channel from their IRC clients.</p>
<p>One of the reasons our new tools have been so impactful is that they are free to use, registration is open to all, and we empower the members of our community to organize themselves. We’re making use of 21 Slack channels, and this system has made it simple for people to align around projects and themes. From <a href="http://creativecommons.slack.com/messages/cc-opened">#cc-opened</a> to <a href="http://creativecommons.slack.com/messages/cc-developers">#cc-developers,</a> you can select a community that supports your interests and give direct, real time feedback to your community members.</p>
<p>It should come as no surprise that commoners love chatting. We’re sending nearly 4,000 messages per week, with over 80% in public channels and direct messages to one another. We’ve also used Slack to send approximately 300 files, passing documents back and forth in order to collaborate on projects. In addition, channels like <a href="http://creativecommons.slack.com/messages/cc-music">#cc-music,</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.slack.com/messages/cc-reads">#cc-reads,</a> and <a href="http://creativecommons.slack.com/messages/cc-certificates">#cc-certificates</a> allow commoners to engage with each other to talk about specific subjects that matter to them.</p>
<p>CC has never had so much daily activity in our online communities. We’re excited to report that this experiment has been a positive experience, connecting people all over the world to each other, and to the commons.</p>
<p>We hope you’ll be a part of the conversation. <a href="https://slack-signup.creativecommons.org/">Join us on Slack!</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eric Phetteplace is a fellow from our first Institute for Open Leadership, held in San Francisco in January 2015. He is a librarian at California College of the Arts. </span></i></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was a member of the inaugural </span><a href="https://creativecommons.org/2015/02/10/report-back-institute-for-open-leadership-meeting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Institute for Open Leadership in 2015</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I&#8217;m the Systems Librarian at </span><a href="https://www.cca.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">California College of the Arts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (CCA), and my IOL project centered around </span><a href="http://vault.cca.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VAULT</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the school&#8217;s digital archive, which I maintain. To quote from my original proposal:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the college has an excellent resource in its digital repository, VAULT, items are often visible only within a department; faculty hesitate to share even with the college community as a whole. What is more, this protective attitude trickles down to students in the form of assignment instructions. Faculty train the next generation of artists to lock down their creations rather than embrace sharing and remixing via the Creative Commons suite of licenses.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has been two years since the IOL, and it is an ideal time to reflect on my project, what was accomplished, and what work remains to be done.</span></p>
<h2><b>Progress, Slow but Sure</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The prime takeaway from the Institute for Open Leadership for me related to increasing the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">understanding</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of open licenses and their benefits. As a librarian, most of my colleagues are not only aware of how important open content is, they actively advocate for it in the form of open educational resources and open access research. Librarians are inclined to sympathize with &#8220;open&#8221; as a concept, and are liable to have produced content licensed under a Creative Commons license or deposited materials in an open repository. But not everyone shares a nuanced knowledge of and appreciation for openness. The IOL, first and foremost, taught me how to clearly articulate what open means, and the tangible benefits it offers. This is evident in </span><a href="https://libraries.cca.edu/iol"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a presentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I gave to college administrators where I devote a great deal of time to contrasting Creative Commons licenses and dispelling myths about them. Providing examples and a space to clear up confusions was invaluable, even if my instincts told me to focus on the implementation and policy details at hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secondly, the IOL helped me to identify allies and stakeholders. Obviously, as mentioned above, the libraries were a natural place to build support. However, I was also able to identify individual faculty members who were already utilizing and promoting Creative Commons content within their classes. I could better articulate the benefits of permissive licensing by putting myself in administrators&#8217;, students&#8217;, or faculty members&#8217; shoes, and framing the conversation around their needs. While my own stance tends towards &#8220;a healthy intellectual commons produces a healthy society&#8221;, that&#8217;s often not the most persuasive point to others. Students, for instance, are intrigued by the prospect of selling their Creative Commons works, or exploring the ways in which readily shareable works are better for self-promotion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the IOL helped me develop a strategy for spreading open content on campus, the progress has been rather slow. When I listed the barriers to my IOL project, a few were:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Misunderstanding or mistrust of open licenses</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Educational_Rights_and_Privacy_Act"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FERPA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and concerns around student privacy</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personal lack of time/capacity</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;ve made substantial progress on the first two items. People I talk to on campus are likely to have a positive opinion about Creative Commons and similar efforts, and view FERPA more as a limitation than an insurmountable obstacle. However, the final hurdle has been the most challenging: on top of my other obligations, which included a couple major system implementations recently, I&#8217;ve struggled to find time to advocate for open policies. It takes a continual fight to see improvements, yet since my initial presentation there&#8217;s been relatively little change to the student and faculty work in our repository.</span></p>
<h2><b>CC-Licensed Archives</b></h2>
<figure id="attachment_51765" style="width: 997px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-51765 size-full" src="https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/libraries-collection.png" alt="VAULT library collection screenshot" width="997" height="623" srcset="https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/libraries-collection.png 997w, https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/libraries-collection-300x187.png 300w, https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/libraries-collection-768x480.png 768w, https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/libraries-collection-64x40.png 64w, https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/libraries-collection-50x31.png 50w, https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/libraries-collection-248x155.png 248w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Screenshot of the library&#8217;s collection within <a href="http://vault.cca.edu/">VAULT</a>. The assets are licensed <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/">CC BY-NC</a>.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the areas where the library has more control over the licensing and distribution of content is the college&#8217;s archives. The archives include both physical documents but also digital objects inside VAULT. The </span><a href="https://vault.cca.edu/hierarchy.do?topic=ed14365a-4935-67ae-0ed9-8dcf2750fdc8"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Libraries&#8217; collections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in VAULT totals over a thousand records, representing everything from historical photos of students from the 1960s to an accreditation report from this October. Since we are in charge of the acquisition and preservation of this content, it was relatively easy to discuss the implications of CC licenses with my library director, who was incredibly supportive of my IOL attendance. We promptly designed a licensing policy and added </span><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CC BY-NC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> licenses to all our public archives content.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, I worked to increase the exposure of our archival content by ensuring our metadata records could be harvested and reused by other platforms. By configuring VAULT to publish data using the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) standard, our content now appears in </span><a href="https://calisphere.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calisphere</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">—a digital library culled from many archives, libraries, and museums located in the state of California—as well as OCLC&#8217;s tremendous </span><a href="https://www.worldcat.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Worldcat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> database that collects the holdings of libraries worldwide. These external search engines increase the exposure of our resources and make it easier for people who never heard of California College of the Arts, much less VAULT, to discover our archives. After all, open content isn&#8217;t really that valuable if no one knows of its existence. Even if all of VAULT was openly licensed, we would still need to increase its exposure such that it&#8217;s not merely a school-wide secret.</span></p>
<h2><b>A Culture of Open</b></h2>
<figure id="attachment_51768" style="width: 840px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-51768 size-large" src="https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ArtFem_CCA_2016_04-1024x682.jpg" alt="Art+Feminism edit-a-thon at California College of the Arts" width="840" height="559" srcset="https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ArtFem_CCA_2016_04-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ArtFem_CCA_2016_04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ArtFem_CCA_2016_04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ArtFem_CCA_2016_04-60x40.jpg 60w, https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ArtFem_CCA_2016_04-50x33.jpg 50w, https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ArtFem_CCA_2016_04-233x155.jpg 233w, https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ArtFem_CCA_2016_04-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Art+Feminism edit-a-thon at California College of the Arts, by Eric Phetteplace, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY</a></figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While my primary project of loosening the licensing restrictions of VAULT has only affected archival works, as an institution California College of the Arts has been improving its understanding of and support for openness. The libraries have started a few projects which relate to Creative Commons and open access to research. For instance, in each of the past two years we hosted an </span><a href="http://www.artandfeminism.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Art+Feminism</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Wikipedia edit-a-thon at a campus library. Wikipedia is one of the most prominent examples of Creative Commons content; it&#8217;s ubiquitous, a great topic for information literacy discussions, and the perfect place for students to add to the commons for the very first time. Unfortunately, Wikipedia also suffers from the topical biases that plague other encyclopedias and much of the Western academic canon: male historical figures and Anglo-European subjects are disproportionately represented. Thankfully, events like Art+Feminism exist to train new editors and to encourage people to contribute Wikipedia articles relating to female artists and feminism. We&#8217;re not only helping to balance Wikipedia’s topical coverage, but we&#8217;re also developing new, open content.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a related note, the CCA Libraries have made a habit of participating in </span><a href="http://openaccessweek.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Access Week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Open Access Week is a week devoted to raising awareness around the open access movement that promotes free access to scholarly content online. As part of our participation, we&#8217;ve posted informative notices around campus and on our website, created a </span><a href="http://libguides.cca.edu/open-access"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study guide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and run small contests to encourage faculty to engage with open access. But what&#8217;s more: we&#8217;ve gone beyond simply advocating for open access content and informing our stakeholders about its value; we’re  actually distributing open content ourselves. Now we have a small but growing </span><a href="https://vault.cca.edu/hierarchy.do?topic=7b5be2a9-4c8a-406c-bb65-dfb51ca1feea"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Faculty Research collection</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in VAULT which provides a place for faculty and staff to post open access versions of their research works.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While these feats are modest, they signal a wider change around campus. Open has moved from being a subject of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">conversation</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a subject of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">action</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Each year, the CCA libraries&#8217; activism expands gradually: we license more archival objects under Creative Commons licenses, we host more events surrounding open access scholarship and open content, and we see growing attendance and awareness. It will continue to be difficult to find the time the cause deserves, but we&#8217;re committed to participating in the open movement and improving our institution one step at a time.</span></p>

<p>Last year, after a series of attacks on refugee centers in Berlin, I saw a Facebook post circulating from my friend Paul Feigelfeld, an academic in Berlin. The post called on his community – academics, artists, translators, and activists – to take action to stop the continued attacks on asylum seekers in Europe. That post and others like it were the spark for <a href="http://refugeephrasebook.de">Refugee Phrasebook,</a> a CC0 open data project with hundreds of contributors. Taking shape over the past year, the book has spread all over Europe, attracting global press in <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/article/tech-startups-refugee-crisis">Wired,</a> <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=newssearch&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjvzpiLwuLQAhUDwiYKHXjIB6sQqQIIHygAMAI&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Feurope.newsweek.com%2Feuropes-refugee-crisis-seven-heartwarming-tales-around-europe-332534&amp;usg=AFQjCNHPRckGvZX0MbmDJhnsTe0FnV_zeQ&amp;bvm=bv.140496471,d.eWE">Newsweek,</a> <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=newssearch&amp;cd=5&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjvzpiLwuLQAhUDwiYKHXjIB6sQqQIIJSgAMAQ&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.stern.de%2Fpanorama%2Fgesellschaft%2Frefugee-phrasebook--berliner-helfen-fluechtlingen-mit-kostenlosem-woerterbuch-6434724.html&amp;usg=AFQjCNGxS7M_sVCJIfyjb0KQxH3EEoQkzA&amp;bvm=bv.140496471,d.eWE">STERN,</a> <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=newssearch&amp;cd=11&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiy7sylwuLQAhUHWSYKHQWKDWU4ChCpAggZKAAwAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.zeit.de%2Fteilchen%2F2015%2F09%2F08%2Fwir-muessen-reden%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNGR0Odu796k5Zsh966KqEOJqtVjzg&amp;bvm=bv.140496471,d.eWE">Die Zeit,</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=newssearch&amp;cd=12&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiUv739uOLQAhXIQiYKHTjbASs4ChCpAggcKAAwAQ&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.spiegel.de%2Fnetzwelt%2Fapps%2Frefugee-hackathon-hacken-fuer-fluechtlinge-a-1059595.html&amp;usg=AFQjCNHcQ9O8JbZN1e7z_IN-ftVKmwOu5g&amp;bvm=bv.140496471,d.eWE">Der Spiegel,</a> <a href="http://www.aec.at/prix/en/gewinner/#communities">as well as winning the Prix Ars Electronica</a> “Award of Distinction” for Digital Communities.</p>
<p>With 1.1 million asylum seekers in Germany, the need for language and education support is acute, and the Refugee Phrasebook helps meet that need. As both a physical and digital resource for refugees, the project has spread rapidly across Europe, and contributors are adding more languages, data, and phrases to continue to support an increasing number of refugees.</p>
<p>Refugee Phrasebook is accepting contributors who want to get involved and collaborate with organizations like the P2P Foundation, CC, and Wikimedia. <a href="http://refugeephrasebook.de">Visit their website</a> to contribute to their global knowledge community.</p>
<p><strong>What was the impetus for the Refugee Phrasebook? How did the project come about?</strong><br />
The urgency of the refugee situation in the summer of 2015 made it immediately clear that language aids were needed for both refugees and helpers. Infrastructure was bad, people had short battery life on their smartphones – if they had one at all – or no data plans to use translation apps, so along with many other small simple projects, a shared document with often used phrases for basic communication and central questions spread over several Facebook groups.<br />
It grew exponentially and was quickly transformed into a Google spreadsheet to make the data easier to expand and maintain. Hundreds of people contributed; there were anonymous contributors, brief contributors, and others on a more long term basis. People started creating the first print versions after only a few days and distributed them at train stations in Vienna or Berlin. It soon found its way to Lesbos, Idomeni, and even Norway. It spread very quickly and received a lot of positive feedback and support from private individuals and institutions like universities, art schools, and art institutions, who provided printers, design expertise, etc.</p>

<p><strong>How did the Refugee Phrasebook evolve from nascency to a global project of this size? What kinds of tools, both digital and physical, helped you scale the project so rapidly? How do you organize the data and translations?</strong><br />
The Google spreadsheets were shared only on Facebook at first, but soon it became clear that we needed more translators beyond the initial group based in Berlin. We created a website as a contact point for contributors, and thanks to Open Knowledge Foundation Deutschland e.V., we could also handle donations and provide an official donation receipt. As the media woke up to the topic, our website was also covered a lot, which helped to reach other initiatives.<br />
To coordinate the project, we mostly use Skype or Zoom calls, Etherpads, Slack, and Trello. In several hackathons, developers helped to improve the structure of the tables and how to display them on the site. But the main factors were a strong sense of urgency, the network effect of personal recommendations, and the data being open, which is still exceptional in this field.</p>
<p><strong>How do the physical and virtual interact in this project as both a virtual collection of data as well as a collection of physical booklets?</strong><br />
It continues to be interesting how virtual and physical realms overlap in this project. First, of course, there are very pragmatic practical problems that arise: how can we create a layout that fits as much information as possible in the best way onto as few pages as possible to keep costs down? Where can we print? This is always done differently: everyone can use the data and create and print their own booklets, or download existing print versions from our website, but often we collaborate with the people who need booklets, help raise money for printing costs, locate affordable printers, organize transport and distribution. Creating the phrasebook alone from data to print to distribution and usage is already an act of conversion and conversation.<br />
All these aspects give us valuable feedback on how to make things easier, where the data is inconsistent, what is lacking in terms of phrases, languages, information and so on. At the moment, we are working on making the conversion from language data in the spreadsheets to printed booklets easier, so people can simply select what they want and don’t have to go through tedious conversion processes. Refugee Phrasebook is a tool for places with the worst infrastructure, which is why it has also been used as insulation during cold weather and to kindle fires. It’s a simple and versatile resource. In this case, it can be helpful to burn books.</p>

<p><strong>What kinds of outcomes have you seen from sharing the data under CC0? Has the use of CC been particularly relevant in terms of your work and what you are setting out to do?</strong><br />
Thanks to the open CC0, the translations could be used in several apps and other translation projects. Designers used it to create signs and other communication aides, local initiatives created custom print versions.</p>
<blockquote><p>Being able to adapt the content to a specific use was especially important for the camps, as refugees encountered different languages across Europe and often could only stay for a few days. In a situation that required urgency, we wanted everyone to be able to adapt and share the translations freely. We will continue to share content under a CC license.</p></blockquote>
<p>The next step is an automatic solution to create custom pdf files as well as more icons.</p>
<p><strong>What kinds of outcomes have you seen from this project, more generally? How have you balanced the project&#8217;s growth in terms of the usage of the physical and virtual assets as well as the ever expanding scope of a project such as this one?</strong><br />
The demand for print versions was a surprise at first, but electricity and wifi is often not available in refugee camps and shelters. A decentralized structure with independent and connected regional projects helped develop our community and supports the project&#8217;s growth. The printing of the phrasebooks is often organized locally. Updating the tables is a time consuming task, so feedback from helpers is an important motivation. In the last month, we saw the demand shift to the south of Europe, where current policies have moved refugees out of sight without providing substantial support. The need for shelter and welcoming culture has not diminished, and language support is only a very small part of what is necessary.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s next for the Refugee Phrasebook? How do you see it evolving?</strong><br />
Though it might be easy to start projects like this it can be harder to sustain them. At the moment we are focussing on consolidating the project while expanding the target language base to improve on translations of prominent but lesser known African languages like Tigrinya.<br />
The growing and changing data set has been included in various other projects from the beginning, often without us even knowing about it. The evening before Refugee Phrasebook received the Ars Electronica Award of Distinction in the category Digital Communities, we received an email that someone in Washington had used it in an app.</p>
<blockquote><p>It lives forth in apps, language learning cards, other aid websites, etc. and is a great example for open data and peer to peer.</p></blockquote>
<p>We do not see it growing and growing, but are looking to build it into a sustainable, stable resource that is easy to use, to expand and adapt into other projects. We hope to continue to develop the global community we have established through the phrasebook.</p>

<p>Open Policy is when governments, institutions, and non-profits enact policies and legislation that makes content, knowledge, or data they produce or fund available under a permissive license to allow reuse, revision, remix, retention, and redistribution. This promotes innovation, access, and equity in areas of education, data, software, heritage, cultural content, science, and academia.</p>
<p>For several years, Creative Commons has been tracking the spread of open policies around the world. And now, with the new <a href="https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/StateofOpenPolicyFullReport_FINAL-1-1-1-1.pdf">Global Open Policy Report <strong>(PDF)</strong></a> by the <a href="https://openpolicynetwork.org/">Open Policy Network</a>, we&#8217;re able to provide a systematic overview of open policy development.</p>
<p><a href="https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/StateofOpenPolicyFullReport_FINAL-1-1-1-1.pdf"><img class="alignright wp-image-51783" src="https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-02-at-5.57.09-PM-721x1024.png" alt="screen-shot-2016-12-02-at-5-57-09-pm" width="274" height="390" srcset="https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-02-at-5.57.09-PM-721x1024.png 721w, https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-02-at-5.57.09-PM-211x300.png 211w, https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-02-at-5.57.09-PM.png 768w, https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-02-at-5.57.09-PM-28x40.png 28w, https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-02-at-5.57.09-PM-35x50.png 35w, https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-02-at-5.57.09-PM-109x155.png 109w" sizes="(max-width: 274px) 85vw, 274px" /></a>The first-of-its-kind report gives an overview of open policies in 38 countries, across four sectors: education, science, data and heritage. The report includes an Open Policy Index and regional impact and local case studies from Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Australia, Latin America, Europe, and North America. The index measures open policy strength on two scales: policy strength and scope, and level of policy implementation. The index was developed by researchers from CommonSphere, a partner organization of CC Japan.</p>
<p>The Open Policy Index scores were used to classify countries as either Leading, Mid-Way, or Delayed in open policy development. The ten countries with the highest scores are Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, France, Kyrgyzstan, New Zealand, Poland, South Korea, Tanzania, and Uruguay.</p>
<p>The Index scores show that open data policies are the most common, while the rarest open policies are in the heritage sector. Our data also shows a clear correlation between the scope of policy and the level of its implementation. &#8220;The Open Policy Index is the first measurement tool that aims at cross-sector comparison of policies, at global scale. The 2016 edition is a prototype which we will be developing further in coming years. We would like to double the number of indexed countries to cover all those in which Creative Commons is active,&#8221; says CC Poland&#8217;s Alek Tarkowski, one of the leaders of the project.</p>
<p>In his introduction, Creative Commons Public Policy Lead Timothy Vollmer calls us to action, saying that with open policies we have the opportunity, the infrastructure, and the ability to &#8220;improve educational opportunities and help solve some of the world’s toughest scientific challenges.&#8221;</p>
<p>This report documents global achievements from teams all over the world. Each section was written by experts in open policy in their region. Kelsey Wiens, Project Manager for the Global Open Policy Report, emphasizes the importance of communities and open policy: &#8220;We need to leverage effective open policies with vibrant, active communities to embrace, embed, and enhance policies in addition to written statements. Without communities like Creative Commons and OPN, policies are simply paper, not actions.&#8221;</p>

<hr />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2016 has been a great year for me both personally and professionally in understanding, embracing, and disseminating the culture of sharing open knowledge. One thing that really helped was my participation in the second </span><a href="https://openpolicynetwork.org/iol/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Institute for Open Leadership</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (IOL), held in March in Cape Town, South Africa.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a researcher in the field(s) of Coastal and Marine Environment and Geospatial Information, I&#8217;m constantly dealing with data. Data are the core of science, and research has to be based on sound and reliable data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since at least 2002, there’s been a strong movement to allow online research outputs (referring principally to scholarly papers) to be published &#8220;free of all restrictions on access (e.g. access tolls) and free of many restrictions on use&#8221; (</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Access movement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When talking about data, things usually get more complicated, and the open access community is still working to find the best way to allow open access to research data. One part of this requires working to convince both researchers and funders that this is the way to support better science.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the marine community there is already a solid history of common standards for metadata and formats. There are also various portals (e.g </span><a href="http://www.emodnet.eu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EMODnet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://www.jerico-ri.eu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jerico</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) and projects (e.g. </span><a href="http://www.seadatanet.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SeaDataNet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) that exist for accessing a great variety of research data related to seas and oceans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, data policies and licences that regulate access to data are, when available, usually custom-made, requiring the filing of specific forms before use. Oftentimes these custom licenses do not clearly address the reuse of data and information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of common, standard, open licences would help users to understand what they can do with the data. It would also ensure that the data providers would be able to easily share their products, with easy to understand conditions for reuse. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My goal as an IOL fellow is to inform relevant marine communities of the benefits of an open research data policy and, more specifically, to apply these principles to the practices within my institute—the Institute of Marine Sciences (ISMAR), part of the Italian National Research Council.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the deliverables for the Italian flagship project </span><a href="http://www.ritmare.it/en/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RITMARE</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Italian research for the Sea), was to clearly define a data policy for the initiative. The </span><a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1235546.v2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">document</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (written in Italian) defines categories of data for which different moratorium periods apply for the release of data; for all data in the project, the document requires that an open license is applied, mentioning Creative Commons licences as one of the standard options, with </span><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CC BY</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as the recommended first choice.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_51747" style="width: 541px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-51747 size-full" src="https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/image00.png" alt="fig 1" width="541" height="629" srcset="https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/image00.png 541w, https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/image00-258x300.png 258w, https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/image00-34x40.png 34w, https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/image00-43x50.png 43w, https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/image00-133x155.png 133w" sizes="(max-width: 541px) 85vw, 541px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Fig. 1: Data Policy rules for the RITMARE project (from Paola Carrara et al., Facing data sharing in a heterogeneous research community: lights and shadows in the RITMARE project. <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.4244375.v2">https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.4244375.v2</a>)</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another way to help RITMARE researchers share their data—and also ensure they receive recognition for their scientific outputs—is by launching a grant program that will provide funding for researchers who wish to publish </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_paper"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data papers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These grants will be provided to support the payment of the article processing fees required by open access data journals. The main requirement of the funding is that researchers must deposit their data in an open access data repository under a CC BY or </span><a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CC0</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> license.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are working on other initiatives that represent a bottom up, collaborative research approach. Among them, two are very well established and almost finalised. First, a repository is being developed that includes digital images of both historical and recent materials belonging to multiple typologies: a historical library, that includes books, photographs, manuscripts, etc. from the end of 16th century; a collection of maps from the 16th century, mostly devoted to the Adriatic Sea and the Lagoon of Venice; an algal collection including an historical section performed during the Second World War containing more than a thousand vouchers, and a modern collection in progress. All these materials will be released under a CC BY license through two main interoperable data portals based on open source infrastructures. Second, the data from six meteo-oceanographic buoys in the Adriatic Sea, has been recently organised in a common database containing time series related to various parameters. This data will be made available as under a CC BY license and will be published an open data in a research data repository.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carlos Moedas, European Commissioner for Research, Science and Innovation, said in a speech on “</span><a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-15-5243_en.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Innovation, Open Science, Open to the World</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” that researchers should be able to rely on free access to research data—and that data needs to be “Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable” (“</span><a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">”). The Institute of Marine Science is embracing these principles by opening its data to the marine community and the wider society. While a comprehensive open data policy for the institute is not adopted, various initiatives are fully supporting this vision. We are making valuable data open and reusable using advances to technical infrastructures, standard formats, interoperable services, and Creative Commons licenses.</span></p>

<p><b></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though internet as infrastructure may have seemed radical only a short while ago, many technologists are now taking a different tack: as a vital part of modern life, access to reliable internet is essential to the development of a just and equitable society. Built in response to proprietary measurement datasets, <a href="http://measurementlab.net">M Lab</a> has assembled the world’s largest collection of open internet measurement data, all under a CC0 license.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A collaborative project from New America’s Open Technology Institute, Google Open Source Research, Princeton University’s Planet Lab, and many others, M Lab’s success stems from their insistence on open data and an open web, maintaining the tests that keep the web free and open. From researchers to consumers, MLab’s data is the backbone of the internet, an example of open collaboration that benefits consumers, researchers, and the future of the web. </span></p>
<p><b>To read MLab’s reports and try their tools, </b><b><a href="https://www.measurementlab.net/">visit the website.</a>  </b>Thanks to Chris Ritzo, Georgia Bullen, Alison Yost, Collin Anderson, and Stephen Stuart for their time in answering these questions.</p>
<p><b> Why does Internet measurement matter? What is the ultimate goal of this project?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Measurement Lab’s goal is to provide an open, publicly available dataset and the platform on which to gather it. There have always been proprietary data sources about the quality of consumer broadband connections, but those were and are the intellectual property of companies like Ookla, Akamai, Google, and network operators themselves. New America’s </span><a href="https://www.newamerica.org/oti/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Technology Institute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Google, and Princeton University&#8217;s Planet Lab formed a consortium to build a data collection platform that could host a common base of internet measurement experiments developed and vetted by the academic research community, be deployed globally, and over time provide what is now the largest open, publicly available internet measurement dataset in the world. Today we run over 100 measurement points around the world and collect an average of over 9 million tests per month worldwide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> From a consumer perspective, are you getting the speed and quality of service you purchased from an ISP? Using a speed test or internet health test provides data to help answer that question. For regulatory agencies, measurement is a means of keeping state on broadband speeds, health, consumer protections, anti-competitive practices and more. For network operators, measurement is paramount to understanding how to provision infrastructure and services. For civil society groups and human rights advocates, it is a means of assessing disparities in accessing the internet, in the quality of available internet services, whether internet traffic is surveilled by state actors or others, and whether and where the internet is censored or blocked. The research community is also keenly interested in openly available internet measurement data, in order to understand and answer many of these issues, and in many cases how they might devise ways to make the internet function better.</span></p>
<p><b>How did you make the decision to use CC0 data? How does your organization support the commons?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">M-Lab uses a CC0 license on the data for experiments that we maintain or contribute to: NDT, Paris Traceroute and Sidestream. We don’t require researchers hosting other experiments to use the same license, but we do require data to be provided openly. In some cases M-Lab will agree to embargo data for an agreed upon period of time such that the researcher can be the first to publish on the data their test collects. But the most popular tests we maintain on our platform </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are licensed with CC0 because we think that this data should be in the public domain, and using a CC0 license allows anyone to freely use it without restriction, particularly those in the academic community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The choice to use a CC0 license goes back to our beginning. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The academic community interested in researching the internet needed a data source and couldn’t get that from private companies. Providing that data would have violated companies’ terms of service with their users, and even if it was legally possible, anonymizing it had been proven <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL_search_data_leak">questionable, if not ineffective.</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Initiatives like </span><a href="https://planet-lab.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Planet Lab</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Princeton University had made some progress toward the idea of a research platform that could be used to collect such data, but didn’t necessarily measure at the scale of the consumer internet. Instead the M-Lab core team engaged with academics, company reps and others to map out what an internet measurement platform might look like to support the work of the research community, that would situate infrastructure to measure the consumer internet, and would provide open data in the service of the public interest. This was the genesis of M-Lab. So from the very beginning we’ve always supported the commons. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The M-Lab core team engaged with academics, company reps and others to map out what an internet measurement platform might look like to support the work of the research community, that would situate infrastructure to measure the consumer internet, and would provide open data in the service of the public interest. This was the genesis of M-Lab. So from the very beginning we’ve always supported the commons.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><b>On your &#8220;About&#8221; page, you write that &#8220;transparency and review are key to good science.&#8221; Can you elaborate on that? How do you feel that your project participates in the scientific process to make the Web better for everyone?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">M-Lab was created as a platform to produce open data about the health of consumer internet connections. Everything from the submission of proposed tests to the hosting of resulting data mirrors the process of submitting a paper to an academic journal. M-Lab defines the parameters that an experiment must adhere to, and academic or regulatory researchers apply to host their tests with us. Applications are reviewed by an experiment review committee to confirm that the researcher has ethical approval from their Institutional Review Board, that the test they propose conforms to M-Lab’s data privacy policy, determines whether the test has overlap with existing tests, and assesses capacity of the researcher for long term support of the test. M-Lab wants to encourage ongoing longitudinal research, not one-off projects, and make the data available openly for broad analysis and research. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We regularly support researchers interested in secondary data analysis with documentation, sample queries and tools to access, visualize and use M-Lab data, and where possible we produce our own analysis and research. This support varies from individual researchers and graduate students, to civil society and research organizations, to national regulatory agencies. In the United States, the FCC’s contractor, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">SamKnows, uses the M-Lab platform to host a portion of the tests for the annual </span><a href="https://www.fcc.gov/general/measuring-broadband-america-open-methodology"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Measuring Broadband America</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program. In Canada, the Canadian Internet Registration Authority (CIRA) hosts three M-Lab sites throughout Canada and has built their own </span><a href="https://performance.cira.ca/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">national data portal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> using M-Lab’s data which also integrates our test. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, because our tests are open source, we support their integration into other websites, software, or other platforms. These developer integrations are key to our expansion and impact in new areas of the world and by new audiences. Most recently, Google’s Search team integrated </span><a href="http://software.internet2.edu/ndt/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Internet 2’s Network Diagnostic Tool</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (NDT) as a top level answer in their Search product. When you search for “</span><a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=how%20fast%20is%20my%20internet"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how fast is my internet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” or similar, the Google version of our test can be run immediately in your browser.</span></p>
<p><b>What kinds of results have you seen that are particularly exciting, surprising, or troubling from this project? What steps can people take to improve the Web? How can they use your project to do so?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">M-Lab initially focused on providing the platform and data, leaving analysis to the research or regulatory community. As we’ve grown in size and interest, we have focused on building more accessible tools to run tests, visualize and download our data as well as support individuals and groups interested in using our data in their work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The M-Lab team is also now working on our own research as well as supporting new inquiries into our data. In October 2014 the M-Lab research and operations team published a technical research report: </span><a href="https://www.measurementlab.net/publications/#isp-interconnection-and-its-impact-on-consumer-internet-performancea-measurement-lab-consortium-technical-report"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ISP Interconnection and its Impact on Consumer Internet Performance</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The data in this report helped to inform the FCC and supported its historic ruling in favor of Net Neutrality in 2015. Our data and analysis showed clear indicators of congestion and bad performance at the Interconnection points between consumer ISPs and Transit providers. We&#8217;ve since presented it to the FCC, NANOG, and at numerous international network operator gatherings. Before the M-Lab report, interconnection wasn&#8217;t even on the FCC&#8217;s radar. We’ve also supported individual researchers interested in using M-Lab data, through our support email, but also directly. In 2015, M-Lab hosted two research fellows who examined our network performance data in new ways. One fellow examined the economic geography of access by using M-Lab data and US Census data. Another worked on a machine learning algorithm that identifies </span><a href="https://www.measurementlab.net/publications/#cusum-anomaly-detection"><span style="font-weight: 400;">anomalies in normalized M-Lab data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, attempting to identify patterns in our data where known internet shutdowns had occurred.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyone can use M-Lab&#8217;s public data, tools and open visualizations for free. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">M-Lab operates in the public interest- providing open data, open source tools, visualizations and documentation to support our own research, and yours. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">P</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">eople can test the speed and latency of their connection using our site: </span><a href="https://speed.measurementlab.net/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://speed.measurementlab.net/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We also have an extension for Google’s Chrome browser, </span><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/m-lab-measure/leijmacehibmiomcnpaolboihcdepokh"><span style="font-weight: 400;">M-Lab Measure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that allows you to schedule tests to be run regularly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because M-Lab data is open and all of our tests are open source, developers can integrate our data or our tests into their own applications, services, web-mashups and more. We provide source code, documentation, and implementation examples to enable you to leverage our data, tests and infrastructure.  learn more about the project and how to get involved in the project <a href="https://www.measurementlab.net">on our website</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and contact us for more information.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below is an update from <a href="http://creativecommons.or.id/">Creative Commons Indonesia</a>, who recently worked with their national copyright office on proposed changes to law that will secure the ability of creators to use CC and other open licenses there. </span></i></p>
<hr />
<p><img class=" wp-image-51249 alignleft" src="https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/copyrightwrench-1017x1024.png" alt="copyrightwrench" width="231" height="320" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In late 2014, Indonesia amended its copyright law to add several new provisions, including changes having to do with database rights, addressing copyright as an object in a collateral agreement, and making license recordation mandatory. The latter is something that could potentially be an issue with regard to the operation of Creative Commons licenses, as well as other open license in Indonesia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“License recordation” means that licensors (even those publishing their works under Creative Commons) must report their licenses with the Indonesian Copyright Office. If a licensor does not comply with the requirement, the license that they applied on their work will not have any legal effect, and will not be enforceable against third parties. This provision is stated in</span><a href="http://eodb.ekon.go.id/download/peraturan/undangundang/UU_28_2014.PDF"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Article 83 of Law Number 28 year 2014</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">license agreements has to be recorded by the Ministry in the general list of Copyright License Agreement with payable fees;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">License agreements which are not in compliance with the license agreement </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">criteria according to Article 82 cannot be included in the general list of Copyright License Agreement;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>If a license agreement is not recorded in the general list of Copyright </b> <b>License Agreement, such unrecorded license agreement will not have any legal effects, and thus not enforceable against third parties</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More detailed provisions on license agreement recordal will be regulated under a Government Regulation.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Creative Commons Indonesia team realized that this provision could possibly complicate the applicability of open licenses under the copyright law. We know that creators publishing under CC do it because the licenses provide an easy and standard way to share creativity with the public, while at least retaining the right to be attributed as the author of the work. The updated Indonesian law would create an artificial barrier to sharing under CC, because it would require licensors to take an additional step in letting the Copyright Office know which of their works are under an open license. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We began to explore the possibility of requesting an exception to the rule for Creative Commons’ licensed works. When we found out that the discussion regarding the regulation had started, we visited the Indonesian Copyright Office. Our aim was to exclude open licenses from the license recordal mandate, ensuring the operation of Creative Commons and other open licenses as they are intended. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On May 23, 2016, we met with the Indonesian Copyright Office, where we were informed that there has been a discussion on the license recordal mandate by the drafting committee, and that open licenses would not be excluded from the license recordal obligation. On September 21, we had another meeting with the Office, where we were asked to provide a written explanation of the operation of open licensing, along with examples of CC licensed materials. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We returned a week later with a draft of our explanation and asked the Copyright Office for feedback and questions. The next day we filed the written request with the Office, and also gathered support from other Creative Commons affiliates by drafting a letter, in case our petition was rejected.. We planned to send out the letter of support from CC affiliates to the drafting committee as our backup plan.. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, on November 1, the Copyright Office informed us that Creative Commons licenses and other open licenses in use in Indonesia will be excluded from the license recordal mandate. The drafting committee agreed to exclude those from the regulation </span><b>because they understand that open licenses are often used in for non-profit purposes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This decision will be included in the preamble of the government regulation, which is still in the drafting process, but will be finally enacted in December 2016 or January 2017.</span></p>
