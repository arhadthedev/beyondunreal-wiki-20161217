<font color="#FFFF00">Team Chameleon Adrenaline Combo</font><br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFF00">Summary:</font><br>
Team Chameleon Adrenaline Combo is specially designed for the team-based game modes such as 
CTF, DOM, BR or the upcoming Assault and Onslaght. The purpose of this combo is to switch player's 
skin color to the color of the opposing team. While combo is active, player may 
confuse players of the other team for a teammate.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFF00">Installation:</font><br>
Just make a doubleclick on the TeamChameleon.ut2mod, and follow the installator's instructions. If your OS 
tells you that it doesn't know how to open this file type, perform the following steps:<br>
<font color="#FF00FF">Step 1:</font> Copy the TeamChameleon.ut2mod into UT2003/System folder. If you don't 
know where this folder is, check UT2003 shortcut's properties. In "Target" field you'll find the path to the "System" 
folder.<br>
<font color="#FF00FF">Step 2:</font>Run from the command line (Start-&gt;Run in Windows) file setup.exe, that is 
located in the same "System" folder, with following parameters:<br><font color="#00cc00"><em>install TeamChameleon.ut2mod</em></font><br>
In Windows you should find the setup.exe via "Browse" button menu and add this string after the path to the file.<br>
<font color="#FF00FF">Step 3:</font> Follow the installator's instructions ;)<br><br>
If during the installation process installator says that it requires some UT2003 version that is less or equal to yours, this means that
one of the files (Manifest.ini) of your UT2003 is damaged or missing. To fix this you need to reinstall UT2003. If you want to use it on 
the server you need to open UT2003.ini (located in UT2003/System folder) and find the [Engine.GameEngine] section and in the end of it add the 
following line:<br>
<font color="#00cc00"><em>ServerPackages=TChameleon</em></font><br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFF00">Usage:</font><br>
To use it start Host Multiplayer Game or Instant Action, depending on what are you going to do, 
setup the game as usual. On the Mutators tab select from the left list mutator named Team Chameleon, 
and add it to the list o used in the game. For the current moment none of the official combos 
(Berserk, Regeneration, Invisible, Speed, Pint-Sized and Camouflage) uses key sequence used by 
Team Chameleon (4 times Right). If any custom does, you need to remove it via removing it's loading 
mutator to avoid any conflicts. In game as you collect 100 units of adrenaline by collecting pills or 
completing games tasks, varying from killing other team's players or scoring goals/capturing flags, tap the 
"Strafe Right" button four times. You'll recieve a "Chameleon!" message. Since this moment for the next 
30 seconds you will look like if you were a player of the opposite team.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFF00">Gameplay notices:</font><br>
Be careful, as some effects are still showing your team attitude, such as translocator's beam, or spawn effect. So avoid using translocator.
The other reason, to be cautious is that your teammates may not notice the team beacon above your head and will start shooting at you, so you'd 
better warn them about your intension to use Chameleon Combo before activating it. But keep in mind not everyone may notice your message, so stay sharp.
Just like any other combo/item affecting visual appearance of the player(for example Invisble combo), this combo doesn't affect bots (I mean they'll see 
you as an enemy). Sorry, but there's no way do that.

<font color="#FFFF00">Version History</font><br>
<font color="#0000ff">v1.0a</font><br>
16 January: found an idea of TurnCoat item on <a href="http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/wiki/Mod_Ideas/TurnCoat" class="my">wiki.beyondunreal.com</a> (found it accidentally by
clicking the "Random Page").<br>
18 January: decided to do something useful, started the editor and was sitting in front of it whole hight, made it work, but combo couldn't get the right texture for the 
character, so it was becoming white =).<br>
19 January: Woke up, added one line, copied into three other places. Combo started working properly.
<font color="#3CCA9F">Features of 1.0a:</font>
<ul type="circle" compact>
	<li>Changes model's body texture to the one of opposing team's color.
	<li>If shoulder ligts are used, changes their colour too.
</ul>
To do in <font color="#0000ff">v1.0b</font><br>
<ul type="circle" compact>
	<li>Support for more than 1 skin texture for body.
	<li>Auto teamsay precaution msg.
	<li>Some emitter effects may be added for the moments while skins are changing.
</ul>
To do in <font color="#0000ff">v2.0</font><br>
I suppose to make v2.0 after the UT2004 will be released.
<ul type="circle" compact>
	<li>Make the combo change not only skins but a mesh, so that the player would look like the real existing player of the opposing team (thanx for the <em>Foxpaw</em> for the idea!).
	<li>Make vehicle's skin change it's color just like the player's skin, if a player with activated combo enters vehicle.
</ul>
