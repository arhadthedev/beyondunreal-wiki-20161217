<p>MutNoAutoFire adds a lot of new features to the game for players to use as well fixes many bugs in the game that were annoying in trials but the main purpose was to fix the auto-firing of ShieldGuns whenever the owner of the gun went to close to a teammate which was really annoying when a server is overpopulated.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Features">Features</span></h2>
<p><b>Features/Fixes</b> <i>MNAF</i> provides a lot of features and fixes for the trials community, here's some of them.</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Pawn Related</b>
<dl>
<dd><b>Animation fixes</b><sup>.:..:</sup> i.e. all animations are now played on the client side as well some gibbing fixes.</dd>
<dd><b>Fading Skins</b><sup>.:..:</sup>, other pawns that are near this Pawn will be fading depending on the distance.</dd>
<dd><b>Mover glitch fix</b><sup>.:..:, Eliot</sup> i.e. forces a suicide if a player is detected to be inside a mover(this was abused by players to glitch through doors blocking levels in trial maps).</dd>
<dd><b>Custom Suicide Message</b><sup>Eliot, .:..:</sup>, the ability to set your own suicide message by using the console command <b>SetSuicideMessage</b> <i>%o OMFG packetloss!.</i> a <b>GetCurrentSuicideMsg</b> command is also available to copy your current suicide message to the clipboard.</dd>
<dd><b>Custom Drowning Damage</b><sup>Eliot</sup>, the ability to change the damage of drowning to none or less/more.</dd>
<dd>'<b>Anti-TeamKilling</b><sup>Eliot</sup>, players could teamkill by shooting a grenade(etc) aimed to a team mate and then switch from team which will make the fired projectile harmful to the team mate, this is fixed by canceling the fire state of player before he switches the team, also all inventory classes and all remaining projectiles that belong to the player are destroyed!.</dd>
<dd>'<b>Anti-MultiDodge hacks</b><sup>Eliot</sup>, players were able to use MD hacks to dodge multiple times while in air to cheat trial maps as well dodge with no delay, this has been fixed by putting a server side check on <i>DoubleClickDir</i> and implementing a server side delay time(false positives are possible, especially with higher ping).</dd>
<dd>'<b>Landing sound fix</b><sup>Eliot</sup>, sometimes the landing sound of players wasn't played at all, this is now fixed though if the surface doesn't have a sound applied it is possible to not hear any landing sound which is quite annoying for trial players when they are trying to time their dodges perfectly.</dd>
<dd>'<b>SJ and the SWD shieldjump combination</b><sup>Eliot</sup> used to overwrite the cool animations of characters after doing like Shield Fire + Jump at the same this is because the damage animation was overwriting the cool animation, this is fixed by disabling the damage animation(it was kinda ugly anyway), this can be undone by using the console command <b>TogglePlayDirectionalHit</b>.</dd>
<dd>'<b>Default Weapon</b><sup>Eliot</sup>, the pawn class also tries to make the <b>ShieldGun</b> weapon to be default selected weapon, by default the <b>AssaultRifle</b> is selected by some code implement inside the gun(online only), however sometimes(depending on ping) the <i>ShieldGun</i> is selected and because people usually want the <i>ShieldGun</i> being the default selected weapon, it got really annoying as it slows down your speedrun, to fix this the Pawn class tries to make the <i>ShieldGun</i> to be always the default selected weapon however this feature does not work perfectly(ping depend) but still increases the chance.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd><b>ShieldGun Related</b>
<dl>
<dd><b>Customize the ShieldGun's Color</b><sup>.:..:, Eliot</sup>, the color of the <b>ShieldGun</b> skin(green) can be set by using the console command <b>SetShieldColor</b> <i>(R=255,G=255,B=255,A=255)</i> i.e. white, an options menu is also available to customize the color by using sliders, to access this use <b>ShieldMenu</b>, <b>ShieldGunMenu</b>, <b>MNAFMenu</b> or <b>SGMenu</b>.</dd>
<dd><b>Auto-Fire fix</b><sup>.:..:, Eliot</sup>, when charging with the original <i>ShieldGun</i> and if an team mate comes very close to you then the <i>ShieldGun</i> would automatic release and so thus ruining your speedrun especially when a room is very crowed, this is fixed by making the automatic feature to only work against non-team mates.</dd>
<dd><b>Reflection Sound fix</b><sup>Eliot</sup>, the original <i>ShieldGun</i> plays a sound whenever reflection is triggered(Alt-Fire) however this sound does not work online, this is fixed.</dd>
<dd><b>Alt-Fire Sound fix</b><sup>Eliot</sup>, the original <i>ShieldGun</i> was meant to play a sound when the shield(Alt-Fire) was activate, this is fixed now offline and online.</dd>
<dd><b>Fire Timing</b><sup>Eliot</sup>, the <i>MNAF</i> <i>ShieldGun</i> adds two new features to time firing, 1. the crosshair color is gold when the <i>ShieldGun</i> is ready to be fired, white if not, 2. if the aimed target is hittable then the crosshair color alpha will be 255, 70% less if not, this can be toggled by using the console command <i>ToggleCrosshairColor</i>.</dd>
<dd><b>Alt-Fire Shield in Third-Person improvement</b><sup>.:..:</sup>, the original <i>ShieldGun</i> shield rotation is only attached to the pawn's rotation, the <i>MNAF</i> <i>ShieldGun</i> improves this by making the shield more accurate to the <i>ShieldGun</i> location and rotation, improving the feel of playing with the <i>ShieldGun</i> in third-person.</dd>
<dd><b>Primary-Fire Charging in Third-Person</b><sup>.:..:</sup>, the original charging effect is not visible to other players, this is fixed and now all players can see that you are charging the <i>ShieldGun</i>.</dd>
<dd><b>Misc</b>, there are several more small fixes and improvements done to the <i>ShieldGun</i>, such as the firing sound pitch/volume is adjusted to make the <i>ShieldGun</i> feel more powerful for its momentum, the net priority and update frequency is also adjusted so that the <i>ShieldGun</i> is updated more and feels better online especially for people with high ping.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Console_Commands">Console Commands</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="ShieldGun_Commands">ShieldGun Commands</span></h3>
